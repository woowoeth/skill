description: Hosted-gateway LLM router — save 88% on inference costs. A local proxy that forwards each request to the blockrun.ai gateway, which routes to the cheapest capable model across 70 models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, xAI, NVIDIA, and more. 5 free NVIDIA models included. Also exposes realtime market data (global stocks, crypto, FX, commodities), Twitter/X intelligence, prediction-market data across Polymarket, Kalshi, Limitless, Opinion, Predict.Fun, dFlow + UMA oracle resolution + wallet identity & clustering, phone-number intelligence (carrier + SIM-swap fraud detection) plus AI-powered outbound voice calls (Twilio + Bland.ai), AND the Surf unified crypto data API (84 endpoints — CEX/DEX, on-chain SQL over 80+ ClickHouse tables, 100M+ labeled wallets, prediction markets, social/CT mindshare, news, VC fund intel) as built-in agent tools. Not a local-inference tool — prompts are sent to the blockrun.ai gateway.

# ClawRouter

Hosted-gateway LLM router that saves <!-- br:savings.autoVsBaselinePct -->88<!-- /br:savings.autoVsBaselinePct -->% on inference costs by forwarding each request to the blockrun.ai gateway, which picks the cheapest model capable of handling it across <!-- br:models.chatVisible -->70<!-- /br:models.chatVisible --> models from 9 providers (<!-- br:models.free -->5<!-- /br:models.free --> free NVIDIA models). All billing flows through one USDC wallet; you do not hold provider API keys.

**This is not a local-inference tool.** ClawRouter is a thin local proxy. Your prompts are sent over HTTPS to the blockrun.ai gateway for model execution. If your workload requires inference that never leaves your machine, use a local runtime like Ollama — ClawRouter is not the right tool for that use case.

## Data Flow

```
Your app → localhost proxy (ClawRouter) → https://blockrun.ai/api  (or sol.blockrun.ai/api)
                                              ↓
                                        OpenAI / Anthropic / Google / etc.
                                              ↓
                                        Response → back through proxy → your app
```

**Sent to blockrun.ai on every request:** the model name, the full prompt/messages body, sampling params (temperature, max_tokens, tools, etc.), and an `X-PAYMENT` header containing a signed x402 USDC micropayment.

**Not sent:** your wallet private key (only the detached payment signature is sent), any other local files, environment variables, or OpenClaw config beyond what's needed for this request.

**Blockrun's privacy stance:** https://blockrun.ai/privacy. Treat prompts the same way you'd treat prompts sent to any hosted LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) — do not send data you would not share with a third-party API provider.

## Credentials & Local Key Storage

ClawRouter does **not** collect or forward third-party provider API keys. You do not supply OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, xAI, or NVIDIA credentials — the blockrun.ai gateway owns those relationships.

**What `models.providers.blockrun` stores (fully enumerated):**

| Field       | Sensitive | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `walletKey` | Yes       | EVM private key used to sign USDC micropayments via x402. **Auto-generated locally on first run** — no user input required. Never transmitted over the network; only detached payment signatures are sent. |
| `solanaKey` | Yes       | Solana keypair (BIP-44 `m/44'/501'/0'/0'`). Auto-derived from the same local mnemonic via `@scure/bip32` + `@scure/bip39`.                                                                                 |
| `gateway`   | No        | Gateway URL. Defaults: `https://blockrun.ai/api` (Base) · `https://sol.blockrun.ai/api` (Solana).                                                                                                          |
| `routing`   | No        | Optional override of the default four-tier router.                                                                                                                                                         |

**How and where keys are stored:**

- Keys live in the OpenClaw user config file — typically `~/.config/openclaw/config.json` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/openclaw/config.json` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\openclaw\config.json` on Windows — under the `models.providers.blockrun` path.
- Written by OpenClaw's standard config writer with `0600` permissions on POSIX systems (owner read/write only).
- **Stored in plaintext**, the same way every OpenClaw provider's API key is stored. ClawRouter does not add an extra encryption layer; your filesystem permissions are the security boundary. If you require an encrypted keystore, run OpenClaw on an encrypted volume (FileVault, LUKS, BitLocker) or use a dedicated burner wallet funded only with what you intend to spend.
- Auto-generation uses `@scure/bip39` to produce a 24-word mnemonic, then BIP-44 derivation for both chains. Source: [`src/wallet.ts`](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/blob/main/src/wallet.ts).

**Operational guidance:** treat the wallet as a spending account with a small top-up, not a long-term store of value. Fund it with what you expect to spend on LLM calls. If the host machine is compromised, the wallet key is compromised — rotate and refund.

## Supply-Chain Integrity

- Every release is tagged on GitHub: https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter/releases
- Every release publishes to npm with a matching version: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blockrun/clawrouter?activeTab=versions
- The `skills/release/SKILL.md` mandatory checklist enforces: same version in `package.json`, matching git tag, matching GitHub release, and matching npm publish.
- To verify locally: `npm pack @blockrun/clawrouter@<version>` and compare the tarball contents to the tagged commit.

## Install

```bash
openclaw plugins install @blockrun/clawrouter
```

The structured `install` block above tells OpenClaw to install the auditable npm package `@blockrun/clawrouter`. Source for every version is on GitHub; every release is tagged.

## Setup

```bash
# Enable smart routing (auto-picks cheapest model per request)
openclaw models set blockrun/auto

# Or pin a specific model
openclaw models set openai/gpt-4o
```

## How Routing Works

ClawRouter classifies each request into one of four tiers:

- **SIMPLE** — factual lookups, greetings, translations → gemini-2.5-flash ($0.30/$2.50)
- **MEDIUM** — summaries, explanations, data extraction → kimi-k2.7 ($0.95/$4.00)
- **COMPLEX** — code generation, multi-step analysis → gemini-3.1-pro ($2/$12)
- **REASONING** — proofs, formal logic, multi-step math → grok-4-1-fast-reasoning ($0.20/$0.50)

Prices are per 1M input/output tokens, on the default `auto` profile. Per-tier
savings percentages are deliberately not quoted here: the published figure is
blended across a stated workload mix, and a per-tier number invites comparing
it against a baseline nobody wrote down. See
[savings-mix.json](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/blockrun/blob/main/src/brand/savings-mix.json).

Rules handle ~~80% of requests in <1ms. Only ambiguous queries hit the LLM classifier (~~$0.00003 per classification).

## Built-in Agent Tools

In addition to LLM routing, ClawRouter exposes BlockRun's x402-gated data APIs as ready-to-use OpenClaw tools. Every tool is paid from the same USDC wallet — no extra setup, no extra API keys.

Seedance is token-priced upstream (~20,256 tokens/sec at the 720p+audio default — 2× the prior 480p rate); `image_url` (image-to-video) costs the same as t2v since 2026-06-01. Seedance 2.0 variants accept optional `real_face_asset_id` (`ta_…`) for BytePlus RealFace character-consistency — mutually exclusive with `image_url`. | $0.05/s (Grok); $0.10/s (Sora 2); Seedance ~$0.46–$1.49 per 5s clip |

### Phone & Voice (Twilio + Bland.ai)

Verify phone numbers and place AI-powered outbound voice calls. **Real-world side effects** — only call `blockrun_voice_call` when the user has explicitly asked to place a call. Server enforces an emergency-number blocklist; ClawRouter does not.

| Tool                             | Purpose                                                              | Price      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `blockrun_phone_lookup`          | Carrier + line type (mobile/landline/voip) for any E.164 number      | $0.01      |
| `blockrun_phone_lookup_fraud`    | SIM-swap + call-forwarding fraud signals (use before SMS-code flows) | $0.05      |
| `blockrun_phone_numbers_buy`     | Provision a US/CA number bound to this wallet (30-day lease)         | $5.00      |
| `blockrun_phone_numbers_renew`   | Extend a wallet-owned number's lease 30 days                         | $5.00      |
| `blockrun_phone_numbers_list`    | List numbers the wallet currently owns + expiry timestamps           | $0.001     |
| `blockrun_phone_numbers_release` | Release a wallet-owned number back to the pool                       | free       |
| `blockrun_voice_call`            | AI outbound call via Bland.ai — up to 30 min, transcript + recording | $0.54 flat |
| `blockrun_voice_status`          | Poll a call's status / transcript / recording                        | free       |

Voice calls are **fire-and-forget**: the POST returns a `call_id` + `poll_url` immediately, the call itself runs in the cloud for up to 30 minutes. Poll `blockrun_voice_status` every 10–30s while in_progress to retrieve the transcript. Slash command: `/cr-call +1<E.164> "<task>" [--voice nat] [--max-duration 5]`. CLI: `clawrouter phone numbers list/buy/renew/release` and `clawrouter phone lookup/fraud <+E.164>`. See the `phone` skill for the full call-flow reference.

### Prediction Markets (Predexon)

Full prediction-market toolbox spanning **Polymarket, Kalshi, Limitless, Opinion, Predict.Fun, dFlow** + Binance for crypto candles. **57 endpoints (Predexon v2) exposed as 9 agent tools** (8 named ergonomic wrappers + 1 catch-all):

- **Markets & trading** — events, markets list per venue, cross-venue search (`markets/search`), orderbooks, candlesticks (per-market and per-token), trades, positions, volume charts.
- **Leaderboard & smart money** — global + per-market leaderboards, smart-money positioning, top holders, smart-activity feed.
- **Wallet analytics** — full wallet profile, P&L time series, per-market breakdown, similar-wallet discovery, batch profiles, AND/OR filters.
- **UMA oracle + wallet identity** — UMA optimistic-oracle resolution status (`uma/markets`, `uma/market/{conditionId}`); wallet identity labels (ENS / Lens / exchange / risk tags), bulk identity, on-chain cluster discovery.

### Prediction-Market Trading (Polymarket) — REAL MONEY

Beyond reading odds, ClawRouter can **place, manage, and redeem real bets** on
Polymarket (CLOB V2, Polygon) via the `blockrun_polymarket` tool. Unlike every
other tool here it is **not** an HTTP-proxy wrapper — it runs a local trading
engine that signs CLOB orders (EIP-712) with the SAME ClawRouter wallet that
pays for LLM calls, and posts them to Polymarket (through BlockRun's Tokyo
egress by default, so it works out of the box in geoblocked regions).

| Tool                  | What it does                                                                                                 | Cost                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `blockrun_polymarket` | `action:` setup / fund / buy / sell / cancel / orders / positions / redeem / withdraw. One multiplexed tool. | Free tool; bets spend pUSD |

- **Funds**: bets spend **pUSD** in a gasless Polygon deposit-wallet vault
  derived from your key; `action:"fund"` moves your **Base USDC → pUSD** gaslessly
  (x402, $0.01 fee, non-custodial). Winnings `withdraw` back to native USDC on Base.
- **Safety**: `confirm:true` is **hard-required** to place/sign anything (omit →
  dry-run preview); per-order cap `POLYMARKET_MAX_BET_USD` (default $25) + optional
  `POLYMARKET_MAX_SESSION_USD`. Bets do NOT draw from the x402 API budget.
- **Zero config**: no Polymarket account, API keys, or gas token — first `setup`
  bootstraps everything from your wallet. Discover token IDs with the
  `blockrun_predexon_*` data tools first. See the **`polymarket-trading` skill**
  for the golden rules and end-to-end flow.

### Crypto Data (Surf) — skill-only integration

Surf is a unified crypto data API with **84 endpoints across 13 domains**: CEX/DEX markets, on-chain SQL over 80+ ClickHouse tables (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, BSC, TRON, HyperEVM, Tempo), 100M+ labeled wallets, prediction markets (Polymarket + Kalshi), social/CT mindshare, news, project/DeFi metrics, token analytics, unified search, VC fund intelligence. The killer feature is `POST /surf/onchain/sql` — ad-hoc SELECT against the warehouse, no indexer required.

**ClawRouter ships Surf as a skill, not as typed wrappers.** The base proxy whitelists `/v1/surf/*` so any call through `http://127.0.0.1:8402/v1/surf/...` flows through the same x402 wallet that pays for LLM calls. The endpoint catalog, parameter shapes, and example flows live in the dedicated **`surf` skill** — Claude Code (or any agent) reads that skill on demand and crafts the HTTP call itself. No `blockrun_surf_*` tool definitions to maintain, no release of ClawRouter when Surf adds endpoint #85.

Pricing tiers (per call, settled in USDC directly to Surf's Base treasury): **$0.001** prices/rankings/lists/news · **$0.005** orderbooks/candles/search/wallet details/social · **$0.02** on-chain SQL/query/schema, chat completions. No monthly minimums, no Surf account, no API key. See the `surf` skill for the full endpoint reference.

This is the pattern for new BlockRun-marketplace APIs going forward: base proxy whitelists the namespace, a dedicated skill documents the surface — no hand-coded tool wrappers per endpoint.
