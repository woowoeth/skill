# Development session handoff

Use the initiative tracked by the current process through the user-profile
`dev-session` command. Run `dev-session current` and accept its result only when
`DEV_SESSION_SLUG` has the same value, as required by the workspace
`AGENTS.md`. Do not use or modify another concurrent session. If no initiative
belongs to the process, create one before making changes or ask for the
intended slug when choosing one would change the task.

Before handing off material work:

1. Update `work/<slug>/state.md` with the current branches, test or CI results,
   blockers, and next operator action. Commit the checkpoint when the workspace
   rules require it.
2. Keep `portal.yml` free of secrets and transient files. Add only useful
   artifacts stored beneath the initiative tracking directory. Repository
   worktrees created with `dev-session worktree add`
   register themselves.
3. Get the stable link from `dev-session url <slug> --as-is`.
4. Put that link in the final handoff after the outcome and any action the user
   still owns. If the portal is not deployed or reachable yet, label the link as
   the post-deployment URL instead of omitting it.

Preparing a handoff does not authorize closing the session. Run `dev-session
archive` or `dev-session delete` only when the user explicitly requests that
lifecycle action. Archived initiatives retain the same URL and become read-only
until `dev-session revive` restores them.
