name: pdf-proof
description: "Use this skill when the user needs visual proof that specific values exist in a PDF — not just to read a PDF, but to see exactly where a number, amount, clause, or field appears on the page with a highlighted screenshot. Trigger when someone is cross-referencing a PDF against something else (a form they're filling out, a claim, a conversation, another document) and needs confirmation with evidence. Common signals: entering data into TurboTax or a form and pulling source numbers from last year's return; asking an accountant to verify reported figures; checking contract terms before sending to legal; matching invoice line items to a PO. The core intent is 'show me the actual text in context' — not summarize, not extract all text, but produce a cropped screenshot with the value highlighted. Do NOT trigger for PDF operations without a specific value to locate: merging, splitting, summarizing, converting, or creating PDFs."

# PDF Proof Page Generator

## What This Skill Does

When a user needs to verify that specific values match their source PDF documents, this skill:

1. Searches the PDF(s) for the exact text of each value
2. Crops a tight, readable section around each match
3. Draws a translucent orange highlight over the found value (using exact text coordinates, not guesswork)
4. Cross-checks by reading text back from the highlighted region to confirm correctness
5. Generates a clean HTML proof page with a summary table, confidence indicators, and per-value proof cards showing the actual screenshots

The output is a standalone HTML file that references cropped PNG screenshots — a visual audit trail the user can keep, share, or refer back to.

**Important:** Always generate the HTML proof page in your first response. Do not just show screenshots inline or summarize values in chat — the shareable proof document is the whole point. Find, extract, and assemble the proof page in one pass.

## How It Works

The key insight is using PyMuPDF's `page.search_for(text)` to get **exact PDF-coordinate rectangles** for each value, then using those coordinates to draw highlights at mathematically precise positions. This avoids the problem of CSS-percentage-based overlays that never quite land in the right spot.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Identify what needs to be proven

From the user's request, extract:
- **Values to verify**: The specific numbers, amounts, or text the user wants confirmed
- **Source PDFs**: Which PDF documents contain the source data
- **Context for each value**: What form/line/field the value comes from (e.g., "Form 1040, line 15", "Invoice #4521, total amount", "Section 3.2, indemnification cap")

#### 2. Search and locate values in the PDFs

Use the bundled `scripts/extract_proof.py` script. It handles the PyMuPDF text search, cropping, and highlight drawing.

**Step A — Find first.** PDFs often contain the same value in multiple places — a form field and its instructions, a header and a total row, or a cross-reference on another page. Jumping straight to extract risks highlighting the wrong occurrence and producing a misleading proof. Run a find first to see all matches:

```bash
python3 /path/to/skill/scripts/extract_proof.py \
  --pdf "/path/to/source.pdf" \
  --search "3,000" \
  --page 39 \
  --mode find
```

Review the output — if there are multiple matches, note which index corresponds to the actual value vs. mentions in labels, headers, or instructions.

**Step B — Extract with verification:**

```bash
# Single highlight (typical for numbers):
python3 /path/to/skill/scripts/extract_proof.py \
  --pdf "/path/to/source.pdf" \
  --search "1,250.00" \
  --page 5 \
  --output "/path/to/output/proof_total.png" \
  --highlight value \
  --mode verify \
  --json

# Multiple highlights (for policy/text questions):
python3 /path/to/skill/scripts/extract_proof.py \
  --pdf "/path/to/source.pdf" \
  --search "Pets are allowed" "$25 per month" "written permission" \
  --page 3 \
  --output "/path/to/output/proof_pet_policy.png" \
  --highlight value \
  --mode verify \
  --json --context 120
```

Parameters:
- `--pdf`: Path to the source PDF
- `--search`: One or more text strings to find and highlight (multiple terms = multiple highlights on the same screenshot)
- `--page`: 1-indexed page number to search on (if known; omit to search all pages)
- `--context`: How many PDF points of vertical context to include above and below the found text (default: 80). Increase for more surrounding context.
- `--output`: Where to save the cropped PNG
- `--highlight`: Highlight mode — `value` (tight box around the text), `row` (full-width band at the text's vertical position), or `none`
- `--scale`: Render scale factor (default: 3 for high-res)
- `--mode`: `find` (locate text), `extract` (crop+highlight), or `verify` (extract + read text back to cross-check)
- `--prefer`: When multiple matches exist — `right` (rightmost, best for forms), `first`, or `last` (default: `right`)
- `--match-index`: Use the Nth match (0-indexed), overrides `--prefer`
- `--json`: Output structured JSON with confidence and verification results

If you don't know the exact page number, run a search pass first:

```bash
python3 /path/to/skill/scripts/extract_proof.py \
  --pdf "/path/to/source.pdf" \
  --search "1,250.00" \
  --mode find
```

This prints every page and coordinate where the text appears, so you can pick the right one.

#### 3. Interpret confidence and verification results

When using `--mode verify --json`, the output includes:

```json
{
  "confidence": "high",
  "confidence_note": "Single match on page",
  "verification": {
    "readback_text": "1,250.00",
    "text_match": true,
    "status": "pass"
  }
}
```

**Confidence levels (based on verification status, not match method):**
- **high / Verified**: Readback verification passed — the highlighted region contains the expected text. Always use this when verification passes, regardless of OCR, multiple matches, or formatting variations.
- **medium / Unverified**: Verification was not run (`--mode extract` instead of `--mode verify`). The highlight is likely correct but not confirmed.
- **low / Check**: Verification failed — the readback text doesn't match the search text. Flag this to the user.

OCR, multiple-match auto-selection, and formatting variations are **metadata** — note them in the extraction details box or screenshot caption, not in the confidence badge.

**If verification fails**, the highlighted region may contain the wrong text. Re-run with `--mode find` to inspect all matches and use `--match-index` to select the correct one.

#### 4. Generate the HTML proof page

**The HTML proof page is the primary deliverable of this skill — always generate it.** Do not stop at showing inline screenshots or summarizing values in chat. The whole point is a standalone, shareable proof document. Generate the HTML proof page in your first response, not as an afterthought.

After creating all the cropped screenshots, generate an HTML file. Read the template from `assets/proof_template.html` and populate it. The template expects a JSON data structure — see the template comments for the schema.

Include confidence indicators in the proof page based on **verification status**:
- Verification passed → green badge "Verified" (`confidence-high`)
- Verification skipped → yellow badge "Unverified" (`confidence-medium`)
- Verification failed → red badge "Check" (`confidence-low`)

OCR, multiple matches, and formatting variations are metadata — note them in the extraction details or screenshot caption, NOT in the confidence badge. If readback verification passed, the badge is always "Verified" regardless of how the match was found.

Read `assets/proof_template.html` for the exact CSS classes and schema. The template comments document the JSON data structure. Here are the key structural rules:

**One proof card per question, not per value.** Structure cards around what the user asked, not around what was searched. A numeric question ("what's the rent?") → one card, one highlight. A policy question ("what does it say about pets?") → one card with a synthesized answer and multiple highlights.

**Header highlights are mandatory.** Every proof card header must surface the answer: `<h3>Field: <span class="highlight">Answer</span></h3>`. For numbers, show the number. For text, show a short answer ("Allowed with permission, +$25/mo"). The user should get every answer from the headers alone without reading screenshots.

**Multiple highlights per screenshot.** The script accepts multiple search terms (`--search "term1" "term2"`) and draws all of them on one screenshot. Use this when a question's answer spans multiple phrases.

**Page metadata is plain text, not a badge.** The page number uses `<span class="badge">` which renders as subtle metadata text, not a label.

**Verification is collapsible.** Use `<details class="verification">` with `<summary>Extraction details</summary>`. This is debug info, not primary content.

**Screenshot captions are omitted** by default — the proof header and description provide sufficient context.

#### 5. Save outputs

Always create a dedicated subfolder for proof outputs — never drop PNGs into the user's main workspace. This keeps the workspace clean and groups related proof files together.

- Create a subfolder named after what's being verified, e.g., `proof-capital-loss-carryover/`, `proof-invoice-4521/`, `proof-contract-terms/`
- Save the HTML file and all PNG screenshots inside this subfolder
- Use relative paths in the HTML `<img src="">` tags (just the filename, no path prefix) so the page works when opened locally
- Share the link to the HTML file inside the subfolder

```
workspace/
  proof-capital-loss-carryover/
    proof.html
    proof_1040_line15.png
    proof_schedD_line7.png
    proof_schedD_line15.png
    proof_schedD_line21.png
```

## Important Technical Notes

### PyMuPDF installation
```bash
pip install pymupdf --break-system-packages -q
```

### Text search precision
`page.search_for()` returns `fitz.Rect` objects with exact `(x0, y0, x1, y1)` coordinates in PDF points. These are the source of truth for highlight positioning. CSS-percentage overlays and manual pixel guesses produce highlights that land in the wrong spot because PDF coordinate systems don't map cleanly to rendered pixel grids — this was the original failure mode that led to building the script.

### Multiple matches on the same page
A value like "3,000" might appear multiple times on a page — once as the actual form field value, and again in nearby instruction text or labels. When the script finds multiple matches, it prints a warning showing all matches with their coordinates and index numbers.

Run `--mode find` first whenever you're unsure a value is unique on the page. This avoids the most common failure: highlighting a mention of the value in nearby instruction text (e.g., "enter the amount from line 21, up to $3,000") instead of the actual form field. Review the match coordinates, identify which one is the real value, and use `--match-index N` to select it explicitly.

The script defaults to `--prefer right` which picks the rightmost match. This heuristic exists because structured forms (tax returns, invoices, applications) place values in right-hand columns while labels and instructions sit on the left. For non-form documents like contracts or reports where values appear inline in paragraphs, switch to `--prefer first` or pick manually with `--match-index`.

### Use verify mode for final extractions
The whole point of a proof page is trust — the user needs to know the highlighted value is actually the right one. `--mode verify` reads the text back from the highlighted region and confirms it matches what was searched for. Without this step, a wrong-match highlight looks correct in the screenshot but proves the wrong thing. If verification fails, the highlighted region contains different text than expected — re-run with `--mode find` and pick the right match.

### Handling text not found
If a value isn't found via `search_for()`:
- Try variations: with/without commas, with/without decimal points, with/without dollar signs, with/without parentheses for negative values
- Try nearby pages (off-by-one is common with PDF page indexing)
- As a fallback, search the full page text with `page.get_text()` and use regex to confirm the value exists, then use a broader crop without a precise highlight

### Negative values in financial documents
Financial PDFs often format negatives as `(3,000.)` or `-3,000` or `3,000-`. Try multiple format variations when searching. The script automatically tries several common variations.

### Crop sizing
- Default context of 80 PDF points above and below gives ~3-4 lines of surrounding text
- For dense forms (tax returns, financial statements, invoices), 60-80 points works well
- For documents with larger text (contracts, letters), increase to 100-120 points
- Always include the full page width (or nearly so) to preserve document structure

### Scale factor
- Scale 3 (default) produces crisp, readable images at typical screen sizes
- Scale 2 is acceptable for simpler documents
- Don't go below 2 or text becomes hard to read

### Scanned PDFs and OCR
Not all PDFs have embedded text layers. Scanned documents, photographed receipts, and older PDFs may be image-only — `search_for()` returns nothing on these.

Add `--ocr` to enable Tesseract OCR fallback. The script automatically detects whether a page has a text layer and only runs OCR when needed:

```bash
python3 extract_proof.py --pdf scanned_receipt.pdf --search "147.50" --mode find --ocr
```

**Requirements:** Tesseract must be installed on the system (`apt-get install tesseract-ocr` or `brew install tesseract`). OCR results are slightly less precise than native text search, so confidence is capped at "medium" for OCR matches.

**When to use `--ocr`:**
- The PDF is a scan of a paper document
- `--mode find` returns no results but you know the value is on the page
- The PDF was generated from a photo or fax

**When NOT to use `--ocr`:**
- The PDF was generated digitally (most modern tax forms, invoices, contracts) — normal search will be faster and more accurate

## Examples

<!-- Add new examples by appending to this section -->

### Financial / Tax

### Financial / Tax
**User says:** "Double-check these capital loss carryover values against my 2024 return and show me proof"

**What to do:**
1. Identify the values and which form lines they come from
2. For each value, `find` → `verify` → extract a cropped screenshot
3. Generate the HTML proof page with summary table + proof cards + confidence badges
4. Save to the workspace and share the link

**Tips:** Tax forms often have the same number in instruction text and in the actual field. Use `--prefer right` (default) since form values are typically in the right column. Always `find` first.

### Legal / Contract Review
**User says:** "Verify the indemnification cap and termination notice period in the signed contract match what we agreed to"

**What to do:**
1. Search the contract PDF for the specific dollar amount and day count
2. Create proof screenshots from the relevant sections
3. Generate a proof page showing both values with their surrounding contract language

**Tips:** For contracts, use `--prefer first` since values appear inline in paragraphs, not in right-aligned columns. Increase `--context 120` to capture more surrounding language.

### Invoice Reconciliation
**User says:** "Confirm the invoice total and PO number match across the vendor invoice and our purchase order PDFs"

**What to do:**
1. Search both PDFs for the matching values
2. Create proof screenshots from each document
3. Generate a proof page that shows both sources, making discrepancies obvious

**Tips:** When comparing across documents, use the same `--context` and `--scale` for visual consistency in the proof page.

### Insurance / Claims
**User says:** "Show me where in the policy document it states the coverage limit and deductible"

**What to do:**
1. Search the policy PDF for the specific amounts
2. Crop the relevant sections with highlights
3. Generate proof cards with the surrounding policy language visible

### Scanned Receipts / Legacy Documents
**User says:** "Find the total on this scanned receipt and show me proof"

**What to do:**
1. Run with `--ocr` flag since scanned receipts have no text layer
2. OCR may be less precise — use `--mode verify` to cross-check
3. If OCR fails, increase the scan DPI or try searching for just the numeric portion without formatting

### Academic / Research
**User says:** "Verify these statistics from the methodology section match what's cited in the results"

**What to do:**
1. Search the PDF for the specific statistical values (p-values, sample sizes, etc.)
2. Create proof screenshots from both sections
3. Side-by-side proof page highlights discrepancies between cited and reported values
