name: loop-setup
description: Use when a project needs the orchestrator-loop documents and config (claude-work/loop.json, the STATUS dashboard, the "Starting the loop" block in docs/LOOP.md), or when loop-start or loop-pause report that loop.json is missing.
---

# loop-setup

Give a project exactly the files `loop-pause` and `loop-start` read. Idempotent; safe to re-run.
**Writes four things and nothing else:** `claude-work/loop.json`, `claude-work/STATUS.md` (if
absent), `docs/LOOP.md` (template if absent, else missing start sections or an explicitly selected client-block migration), one `.gitignore` line. Other edits you think the project needs (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md pointer,
old hand-off notes, DECISIONS) are **printed as suggestions**, never made.

Read [the shared runtime contract](../loop-start/references/runtime.md). Resolve this loaded
SKILL.md to its real path (follow installation symlinks); templates are at `../../templates/`
relative to its skill folder. Never assume a Claude home path. If the package resources are
missing, stop with a reinstall instruction.

## 1. Discover, then ask only for what is missing

Read-only. Offer each discovered value as the default; ask one question at a time for the rest.

| key | discover from |
|---|---|
| `project` | AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md title / `gh repo view --json name` |
| `repo`, `default_branch` | `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,defaultBranchRef` |
| `status_file` | `claude-work/STATUS.md` (convention) |
| `loop_doc` | `docs/LOOP.md` if it exists |
| `notify` | a `scripts/notify-*.sh`; written with its `./` prefix; absent → ask, allow empty |
| `mention` | an existing `<@digits>` in LOOP.md / STATUS.md; else ask (may be empty) |
| `bot_user` | `AGENT_BOT_USER` in `.sandbox-pal-dispatch/config.defaults.env` and any explicit `config.env` override (read assignments, never source files or print secrets), else `gh api user -q .login`; say which identity runs `gh` in the loop |
| `board` | `gh project list --owner <org> --format json` → pick by name; **object** `{"org","number","done":"Done"}`, or `null` |
| `pipeline` | `sandbox-pal` if `.sandbox-pal-dispatch/` exists |
| `agent_branch_prefix`, `cleanup_pr_prefix` | defaults `agent/issue-`, `chore: post-merge cleanup` |

## 2. `claude-work/loop.json` — the schema is this skill's, not the project's

```json
{
  "project": "…", "repo": "owner/name", "default_branch": "main",
  "status_file": "claude-work/STATUS.md", "loop_doc": "docs/LOOP.md",
  "notify": "./scripts/notify-discord.sh", "mention": "<@…>", "bot_user": "…",
  "board": {"org": "…", "number": 1, "done": "Done"},
  "pipeline": "sandbox-pal",
  "agent_branch_prefix": "agent/issue-", "cleanup_pr_prefix": "chore: post-merge cleanup"
}
```

Save the shared workflow once. For new configuration use the actual client's ordinary
backend automatically; do not present a runtime menu:

```json
"default_modes": {"claude": "persistent", "codex": "goal"},
"start_blocks": {
  "claude": {"persistent": "Starting the loop"},
  "codex": {"goal": "Starting the loop (Codex Goal)"}
}
```

Render `templates/CODEX-GOAL.md` into the project loop document, substituting the discovered
project/path fields and concrete `{{outcome}}` and `{{human_checkpoint}}`. Infer these from
the approved plan; ask only if the intended scope/checkpoint is missing. Include its
Interactive Goal policy and show how it scopes existing scheduler-specific clauses. Read [the Goal guide](../loop-start/references/codex-goal.md).
Check actual session tools or native `/goal` UI availability; installation/version/config is
not proof of working lifecycle controls. Record unresolved support honestly. Setup never
creates a Goal. No timer hosting or arbitrary iteration/token cap is required.

Preserve unknown keys, paths, Claude commands and explicit saved legacy choices. Show the
migration diff before replacing a saved Codex timer/bounded choice with Goal. User approval
of that migration is sufficient; do not ask again. When Codex has no saved default it routes
to Goal, but still needs this project block. Optional `--once` uses a bounded block; timer
hosting is configured only when requested. Never silently downgrade unavailable Goal.

For Codex supervised operation, read
[the supervisor guide](../loop-start/references/codex-supervisor.md) and propose additive
`codex_supervisor`/`start_blocks` config and both rendered project blocks from
`templates/CODEX-SUPERVISOR.md`. Review timer-policy compatibility. For an optional one-off
command, use the bounded block in templates/LOOP.md. Never replace the existing Claude
block or weaken any gate. Do not install services or change authentication during setup.

Validate that every saved default has a corresponding project command; supervised also
requires its pause block. Show the selected behavior and any unresolved host prerequisites
in the setup diff. Existing projects can keep using their explicit mode flags until setup
saves a default. Existing config without defaults still works unchanged in Claude.

Existing file: never overwrite a key silently — show the diff per key and ask. Validate with
`jq .` before committing.

## 3. `docs/LOOP.md`

- Absent → render `templates/LOOP.md`, substituting `{{project}} {{repo}} {{default_branch}}
  {{status_file}} {{loop_doc}} {{notify}} {{mention}} {{bot_user}} {{channel}} {{human}}
  {{board_url}} {{pipeline}}`. Leave the `PROJECT-OWNED` comments for the project to fill.
- Present → if no `## Starting the loop` heading, append the template's "Starting the loop"
  section (heading, the fenced `/loop` block, the two closing sentences) before `## Ground
  rules` if that heading exists, else at the end. **Never edit other sections.** Adding a client
  block (and its runtime policy) to an existing document requires an explicitly selected setup migration, with its diff
  shown before changing the existing config. Project-specific
  clauses may be added inside the fenced block after the template text, each one a sentence.

## 4. `claude-work/STATUS.md`

Absent → render `templates/STATUS.md` (`{{date}}` = UTC now). Present → untouched, even if it
looks stale; say so.

## 5. `.gitignore`, commit, hand-off

- Append `claude-work/.loop-owner` to `.gitignore` if missing.
- For native Goal setup, preserve the current branch, staged/untracked changes and unpublished
  commits. Edit only the four scoped artifacts; stage only intended changes if committing is
  authorized. No clean-main, push or worktree migration is required merely to set up/start.
  Publish only under the project policy and user authorization; disclose local-only setup.
- For the legacy scheduled/bounded workflow, one commit on `default_branch`: `docs: loop setup — loop.json, STATUS.md, LOOP.md start block`.
  Push only if the tree was clean before you started and no CI run on `default_branch` is in
  progress; otherwise leave it committed and say so.
- Print what was written, the saved behavior and any unresolved prerequisites. The normal
  hand-off is `next: $loop-start` for Codex or `next: /loop-start` for Claude. These are chat
  prompts, not shell commands. Mention `--once` only as an optional single-iteration override.

## Rationalisations that mean you left the four-file scope

| thought | reality |
|---|---|
| "CLAUDE.md should point at STATUS too" | Suggest it. Setup writes four things. |
| "the old hand-off doc will compete with the dashboard" | Suggest a one-line banner. Don't edit it. |
| "the board is easier as a URL" | The other skills read `{org, number, done}`. Schema is fixed. |
| "the start block reads better rewritten for this project" | Template block first, project clauses appended. Same contract everywhere. |
