# Hivemind Memory

You have TWO memory sources. ALWAYS check BOTH when the user asks you to recall, remember, or look up ANY information:

1. **Your built-in memory** — personal per-project notes from the host agent
2. **Hivemind global memory** — global memory shared across all sessions, users, and agents in the org, accessed via the tools below

## Memory Structure

```
/index.md                           ← START HERE — table of all sessions
/summaries/
  <username>/
    <session-id>.md                 ← AI-generated wiki summary per session
/sessions/
  <username>/
    <user_org_ws_slug>.jsonl        ← raw session data
```

## How to Search

1. **First**: call `hivemind_index()` — table of all sessions with dates, projects, descriptions
2. **If you need details**: call `hivemind_read("/summaries/<username>/<session>.md")`
3. **If you need raw data**: call `hivemind_read("/sessions/<username>/<file>.jsonl")`
4. **Keyword search**: call `hivemind_search("keyword")` — substring search across both summaries and sessions, returns `path:line` hits

Do NOT jump straight to reading raw JSONL files. Always start with `hivemind_index` and summaries.

## Organization Management

- `/hivemind_login` — sign in via device flow
- `/hivemind_capture` — toggle capture on/off (off = no data sent)
- `/hivemind_whoami` — show current org and workspace
- `/hivemind_orgs` — list organizations
- `/hivemind_switch_org <name-or-id>` — switch organization
- `/hivemind_workspaces` — list workspaces
- `/hivemind_switch_workspace <id>` — switch workspace
- `/hivemind_version` — show installed version and check npm for updates
- `/hivemind_update` — shows how to install (ask the agent, or run `hivemind update` in your terminal)
- `/hivemind_autoupdate [on|off]` — toggle the agent-facing update nudge (on by default: when a newer version is available, the agent is prompted to install it via `exec` if you ask to update)

## Skill Management (skillify)

Hivemind also mines reusable Claude skills from agent sessions and stores them in a per-org Deeplake table. Openclaw itself doesn't run sessions to mine, but you can pull skills others have already mined for the user. These run in the user's terminal (the openclaw plugin does not register them as `/hivemind_*` commands):

- `hivemind skillify` — show scope/team/install + per-project state
- `hivemind skillify pull` — sync skills for the current project from the org table
- `hivemind skillify pull --user <email>` — only that author's skills
- `hivemind skillify pull --users a,b,c` — multiple authors (CSV)
- `hivemind skillify pull --all-users` — explicit "no author filter"
- `hivemind skillify pull --to project|global` — install location (`<cwd>/.claude/skills/` vs `~/.claude/skills/`)
- `hivemind skillify pull --dry-run` — preview without touching disk
- `hivemind skillify pull --force` — overwrite local (creates `.bak`)
- `hivemind skillify pull <skill-name>` — pull only that one skill (combines with `--user`)
- `hivemind skillify push <skill-name>` — upload a local skill to the org table (inverse of pull; re-push lands a new version)
- `hivemind skillify push --from project|global` — which local skills dir to read (default: project)
- `hivemind skillify push --dry-run` — preview without writing to the org table
- `hivemind skillify unpull` — remove every skill previously installed by pull
- `hivemind skillify unpull --user <email>` — remove only that author's pulls
- `hivemind skillify unpull --not-mine` — remove all pulls except your own
- `hivemind skillify unpull --dry-run` — preview without touching disk
- `hivemind skillify scope <me|team>` — set sharing scope for new skills
- `hivemind skillify install <project|global>` — default install location
- `hivemind skillify team add|remove|list <name>` — manage team list

If the user asks to "pull skills from X", "share skills with the team", or similar, suggest the matching `hivemind skillify` command. Run `hivemind skillify --help` for the full reference.

## Limits

Do NOT delegate to subagents when reading Hivemind memory. If a tool call returns empty after 2 attempts, skip it and move on. Report what you found rather than exhaustively retrying.

## Getting Started

After installing the plugin:
1. Run `/hivemind_login` to authenticate
2. Run `/hivemind_setup` to enable the memory tools in your openclaw allowlist (one-time, per install)
3. Start using memory — ask questions, the agent automatically captures and searches

## Sharing memory

Multiple agents share memory when users are in the same Activeloop organization.
