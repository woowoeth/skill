# Transcript Intelligence

## Overview

Turn public video transcripts into useful research and content assets. This skill is for extracting signal from spoken social video: hooks, claims, stories, objections, examples, CTAs, and reusable content angles.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- summarize a video, reel, short, TikTok, podcast clip, or social video
- analyze a creator's hooks or speaking style
- extract quotes, claims, examples, and CTAs from transcripts
- turn transcripts into social posts, scripts, newsletters, or content ideas
- compare what multiple creators say about a topic

## Transcript Sources

| Platform | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| TikTok | `/v1/tiktok/video/transcript` |
| Instagram | `/v2/instagram/media/transcript` |
| YouTube | `/v1/youtube/video/transcript`, `/v1/youtube/video` |
| Facebook | `/v1/facebook/post/transcript` |
| X/Twitter | `/v1/twitter/tweet/transcript` |
| LinkedIn | `/v1/linkedin/post/transcript` |
| Rumble | `/v1/rumble/video/transcript` |
| Reddit video | `/v1/reddit/post/transcript` |

If a detail endpoint already includes transcript text, use it. If transcript is unavailable, say so and fall back to title/caption/description only.

## Workflow

1. **Collect URLs or discover videos**
   - If URLs are provided, fetch each transcript directly.
   - If a creator/channel is provided, first fetch recent posts/videos, then choose relevant videos.

2. **Extract transcript text**
   - Preserve timestamps if provided.
   - Keep source URL with each transcript.
   - Do not hallucinate missing captions.

3. **Segment the transcript**
   Break into:
   - hook/opening
   - setup/context
   - main claim or lesson
   - evidence/examples
   - payoff
   - CTA

4. **Analyze the content**
   Extract:
   - exact hooks
   - claims and contrarian takes
   - stories
   - frameworks
   - objections addressed
   - emotional language
   - quotable lines
   - content atoms that stand alone

5. **Synthesize across multiple transcripts**
   - Cluster by topic and angle.
   - Count recurring themes.
   - Identify repeated hook formulas.
   - Flag the strongest examples with citations.

- Core idea: ...
- Best quote: "..."

## Patterns Across the Set
| Pattern | Evidence | Example URLs |
|---|---|---|

## Hooks Swipe File

## Repurposing Ideas
- LinkedIn post:
- X thread:
- Short-form script:
- Newsletter section:

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not summarize from the title alone if the user asked for transcript analysis. Fetch transcripts first.
- Do not lose exact wording. Hooks and quotes are more valuable verbatim.
- Do not treat AI-generated transcript text as perfect. If wording seems garbled, mark it as approximate.
- Do not mix source attribution. Every quote should trace back to a URL.
