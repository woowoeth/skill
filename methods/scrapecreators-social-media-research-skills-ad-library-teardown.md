# Ad Library Teardown

## Overview

Analyze public ads to understand a competitor's messaging, offers, creative strategy, and testing angles. The output should be a practical teardown marketers can use to write better ads or decide what to test.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- analyze a competitor's active ads
- search Meta/Facebook, Google, or LinkedIn ad libraries
- extract ad hooks, CTAs, claims, offers, and landing page angles
- compare ad messaging across competitors
- summarize video ad transcripts
- generate ad test ideas from competitor ads

## Data Sources

| Ad library | Search/list endpoint | Detail endpoint | Transcript endpoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meta/Facebook | `/v1/facebook/adLibrary/search/ads`, `/v1/facebook/adLibrary/company/ads`, `/v1/facebook/adLibrary/search/companies` | `/v1/facebook/adLibrary/ad` | `/v1/facebook/adLibrary/ad/transcript` |
| Google | `/v1/google/adLibrary/advertisers/search`, `/v1/google/company/ads` | `/v1/google/ad` | n/a |
| LinkedIn | `/v1/linkedin/ads/search` | `/v1/linkedin/ad` | n/a |

## Workflow

1. **Find the advertiser**
   - Use company search endpoints when the user provides only a brand name.
   - Use domain/advertiser/page IDs when available.

2. **Fetch active ads**
   - Prefer active ads unless the user asks for historical analysis.
   - Capture platform, advertiser/page, ad ID, start date, creative type, text, headline, CTA, destination URL, and source URL.

3. **Fetch details for representative ads**
   - Enrich the ads with detail endpoints.
   - For video Meta ads, fetch transcripts when available.

4. **Cluster messaging**
   Group ads by:
   - pain point
   - persona
   - offer
   - proof/social proof
   - feature/benefit
   - objection handled
   - comparison/alternative angle
   - urgency/discount

5. **Extract swipeable elements**
   - hooks
   - headlines
   - primary text patterns
   - CTAs
   - claims
   - offers
   - visual/creative concepts

6. **Recommend tests**
   Suggest tests based on repeated patterns and gaps, not random ideas.

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not claim an ad is winning just because it is active. Say it is active or repeated; performance is not public unless the endpoint returns it.
- Do not ignore repeated ads. Repetition is often a useful signal.
- Do not invent spend, conversion rate, or targeting unless public data includes it.
- Do not skip video transcripts when the user asks for hooks or messaging from video ads.
