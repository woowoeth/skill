  Operate any Obsidian vault as a living, self-rewriting second brain (an evolution
  of Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern: sources rewrite existing pages, contradictions
  reconcile automatically, scheduled agents maintain the vault while you sleep).
  Use this skill whenever
  the user asks Claude to read, write, update, search, or manage their Obsidian
  vault - including saving notes from conversation, creating daily entries, updating
  kanban boards, logging dev work, managing people notes, capturing decisions,
  tracking deals, or maintaining any vault structure. Also triggers when the user
  wants to bootstrap a new vault from scratch, run a vault health check, or drop
  a _CLAUDE.md into their vault so all Claude surfaces share the same operating rules.
  Includes a research toolkit (7 commands: /x-read, /x-pulse, /research, /research-deep,
  /notebooklm, /youtube, /podcast) for AI-powered research via Grok, Perplexity, NotebookLM,
  YouTube, and podcast feeds - findings save
  to the vault automatically following the AI-first vault rule. Use proactively whenever
  the conversation produces information worth preserving (decisions, people met, projects
  started, tasks completed, lessons learned, research findings).

# Obsidian Second Brain

> Claude operates your Obsidian vault as a self-rewriting knowledge base. An evolution of [Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f): sources rewrite existing pages instead of just appending, contradictions reconcile automatically, and scheduled agents maintain the vault while you sleep.
> Everything worth remembering gets saved. Every update propagates everywhere it belongs.

## Quick Start

### 0. Choose vault access method (in order of preference)

Try these methods in order. Use the first one available:

**Method 0 - SessionStart hook (if configured):**
If `hooks/load_vault_context.py` is wired as a SessionStart hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`, `_CLAUDE.md` is injected into context automatically at session start. Skip step 1 below.
To wire it: `bash scripts/setup.sh "/path/to/vault"` or run `/obsidian-setup`.

**Method A - Direct filesystem (default, always works):**
Use standard file tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob) against the vault path. The vault is plain markdown, so every operation in this skill works this way with no setup. This is the normal path in Claude Code - the commands below use these tools directly.

**Method B - MCP server (optional, mainly for non-Claude-Code clients):**
This repo ships its own MCP server at `integrations/obsidian-mcp-server/` that exposes the vault as tools (`obsidian_search`, `obsidian_read_note`, `obsidian_save_note`, `obsidian_capture`, plus curator tools). It exists so other MCP clients - Hermes Agent, Claude Desktop, Cursor - can use the vault as a knowledge layer; in Claude Code itself, Method A is simpler and preferred. If those `obsidian_*` tools happen to be available in your client, you may use them instead of raw file tools. Setup lives in `integrations/obsidian-mcp-server/README.md` (it is `uv run --with 'mcp<2' python .../server.py` with `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` set, not an `npx` package).

### 1. First time in a vault → read `_CLAUDE.md`

Before doing anything in a vault, check if `_CLAUDE.md` exists at the vault root and read it:

```
Read <vault>/_CLAUDE.md
```

If it exists: follow its rules exactly - they override the defaults in this skill. Where `_CLAUDE.md` is silent, fall back to the defaults below.
If it doesn't exist: use the defaults in this skill, then offer to create one.

If the SessionStart hook is active, `_CLAUDE.md` is already in context - skip this step.

### 2. First time with a new user → run discovery

```
Glob <vault>/**/*.md
```

Scan the structure to understand: folder names, template locations, naming conventions, frontmatter patterns. Then read 2-3 existing notes to calibrate writing style before creating anything new.

### 3. Bootstrap a new vault

If the user has no vault yet, run:
```bash
# One-line install + bootstrap (asks 3 questions: vault path, your name, preset)
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eugeniughelbur/obsidian-second-brain/main/scripts/quick-install.sh | bash

# Or manual:
python scripts/bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/path/to/vault --name "Your Name"

# With a preset:
python scripts/bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "Your Name" --preset executive
python scripts/bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "Your Name" --preset builder
python scripts/bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "Your Name" --preset creator
python scripts/bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "Your Name" --preset researcher

# With assistant mode (maintaining vault for someone else):
python scripts/bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "Your Name" --mode assistant --subject "Boss Name"
```

Then just point the skill at the new vault path (Method A above). If you use the optional bundled MCP server, set `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` to the new path and restart the client.

**Presets** customize the vault for different use cases:
- **`executive`** - Decisions, people, meetings, strategic planning. Kanban: OKRs, Quarterly, Weekly.
- **`builder`** - Projects, dev logs, architecture decisions, debugging. Kanban: Backlog, Sprint, Done.
- **`creator`** - Content calendar, ideas pipeline, audience notes, publishing. Kanban: Ideas, Drafts, Published.
- **`researcher`** - Sources, literature notes, hypotheses, methodology. Kanban: Reading, Processing, Synthesized.

Default (no preset) gives a general-purpose vault. All presets use wiki-style by default.

**Assistant mode** creates a `_CLAUDE.md` configured for operating a vault on behalf of someone else. See `references/claude-md-assistant-template.md`.

See `references/vault-schema.md` for full structural details.

## Core Operating Principles

### AI-first vault rule (applies to every note)
The vault is designed for **future agent** to read and reason over, not for human review. Every note Claude writes - across all 46 commands - must follow `references/ai-first-rules.md`:

1. **Self-contained context** - each note explains itself; don't rely on backlinks alone
2. **"For future agent" preamble** - 2-3 sentence summary so any compatible agent can decide relevance in 10 seconds
3. **Rich, consistent frontmatter** - `type`, `date`, `tags`, `ai-first: true`, plus type-specific fields (see `ai-first-rules.md` for schemas per note type)
4. **Recency markers per claim** - "Mem0 raised $24M (as of 2026-04, mem0.ai)" so future agent knows what to verify
5. **Sources preserved verbatim** - every external claim has its source URL inline
6. **Cross-links mandatory** - every person/project/idea/decision uses `[[wikilinks]]`
7. **Confidence levels** - `stated | high | medium | speculation` where applicable

This rule lives in `_CLAUDE.md` Section 0 of every vault using this skill, and in `references/ai-first-rules.md` (the canonical specification with frontmatter schemas + preamble templates per note type). That path is relative to the install root, which is load-bearing: if it does not resolve from your working directory, search upward for it, and if you still cannot read it, say so before writing rather than producing a note that silently skips the rule. The seven requirements above are the floor and apply whether or not the spec is reachable.

### Never create in isolation
Every write operation must ask: *where else does this belong?*

| You create/update... | Also update... |
|---|---|
| A new project note | Kanban board (add to Backlog), today's daily note (link it) |
| A task completed | Kanban board (move to Done), project note (log it), daily note |
| A person note | Daily note (mention interaction), People index if it exists |
| A dev log | Daily note (link it), project note (Recent Activity) |
| A deal update | Side Biz / Deals kanban, Dashboard totals |
| A decision made | Project note (Key Decisions), daily note |
| A mention/shoutout | Mentions Log, person's note, daily note |
| A hook, contrarian angle, or content idea | `social-media/ideas.md` (if folder exists) |
| A specific reusable number or stat | `social-media/data-points.md` (if folder exists) |
| An external post that performed well + why | `social-media/swipe-file.md` (if folder exists) |
| Research findings worth keeping | `social-media/research/YYYY-MM-DD - topic.md` (if folder exists) |
| Any vault write | operation log (`Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` if `Logs/` exists, else `log.md`), `index.md` (update if new note created) |

Always propagate. Never create a single orphaned note.

### Bi-temporal facts - never overwrite, always append
When a fact changes (role, company, status, location, tool), NEVER delete the old value. Add a new entry to the `timeline:` frontmatter array with both event time AND transaction time:

```yaml
timeline:
  - fact: "CTO at Currentscale Labs"
    from: 2024-01-01            # event time: when it was true
    until: 2026-04-07
    learned: 2026-02-23         # transaction time: when the vault learned it
    source: "[[2026-02-23]]"    # where from
  - fact: "Architect at Currentscale Labs"
    from: 2026-04-07
    until: present
    learned: 2026-04-07
    source: "[[2026-04-07]]"
```

Top-level fields (`role:`, `status:`, `company:`) always reflect the CURRENT state. The `timeline:` preserves the full history with provenance.

This enables:
- Historical queries ("who was my manager in February?")
- Reflective thinking ("you believed X on Tuesday, then ingested Y on Wednesday and shifted to Z")
- Smart reconciliation (different facts at different times = not a contradiction)
- Full audit trail (when did the vault learn each fact, from what source?)

### CRITICAL_FACTS.md - always loaded
A tiny file (~120 tokens) loaded alongside `SOUL.md` at L0 in every session. Contains facts needed in every conversation:
- Timezone
- Current manager
- Current location
- Current company and role
- Any other fact that's true RIGHT NOW and relevant to every interaction

Update this file whenever a critical fact changes. Keep it under 150 tokens.

### Raw is immutable
In wiki-style vaults, the `raw/` folder contains original sources (articles, transcripts, PDFs). Claude reads these but NEVER modifies them. They are the source of truth. If a wiki page gets corrupted, re-derive it from the raw source. When ingesting, always save the original to `raw/` and the derived pages to `wiki/`.

### Maintain `index.md` and `log.md`
Two structural files that keep the vault navigable and auditable:

- **`index.md`** - A catalog of all vault pages organized by category. Claude reads this FIRST when navigating the vault instead of searching - faster and cheaper on tokens. Update it whenever a new note is created or deleted. Format: `- [[Note Name]] - brief description` grouped under folder headings.

- **`log.md`** - An append-only chronological log of every vault operation. Every save, ingest, health check, and structural change gets a timestamped entry. Never delete or rewrite entries - only append. Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] action | Description`

### Per-day operation logs (modernized vaults)
Vaults initialized with `/obsidian-init` (v0.9+) use a split log structure instead of a monolithic `log.md`:

- **`Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`** - one file per day, append-only. Format: `**HH:MM** - action | description`
- **`log.md` at vault root** - pointer file only. Never write entries here; it explains the per-day structure and ships the entry template.

To migrate an existing monolithic `log.md`: run `python scripts/migrate_log.py --vault <path>`.
To refresh the stats block in `index.md` after bulk writes: run `python scripts/vault_stats.py --vault <path>`.

When writing operation log entries, check whether the vault uses the old (`log.md`) or new (`Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) structure and write to the correct location.

### The vault is a living system
The vault is not a filing cabinet. It is a living knowledge base that rewrites itself with every input. When new information enters:
- Existing pages get REWRITTEN with new context, not just appended to
- Contradictions between old and new claims get resolved or explicitly documented
- New patterns across multiple sources trigger automatic synthesis pages
- Stale claims get replaced with current information, with history preserved

The vault after an ingest should be DIFFERENT - not just bigger. If pages that existed before aren't smarter, more connected, and more current, the ingest wasn't deep enough.

### Two-Output Rule
Every interaction that produces insight must generate two outputs:
1. **The answer** - what the user sees in the conversation
2. **A vault update** - the insight filed back into the relevant note(s)

This applies to all thinking tools and any query where Claude synthesizes information from the vault.

### Synthesis Hook
When Claude notices a pattern during any operation (ingest, query, challenge, emerge), it should automatically create a synthesis page in `wiki/concepts/`. Patterns include:
- The same concept appearing in 3+ unrelated sources
- A claim being reinforced by multiple independent sources
- A trend emerging across time-sequenced notes
- Two entities sharing unexpected connections

Synthesis pages are the vault thinking for itself - connecting dots the user hasn't connected yet.

### Reconciliation
The vault should never contain two pages that disagree without knowing they disagree. When contradictions are found (during ingest, health checks, or queries), either:
- Resolve them: rewrite the outdated page, preserve history
- Document them: create an explicit conflict page marked as an open question

Use `/obsidian-reconcile` for vault-wide truth maintenance.

### Proactive save reminders
Unsaved conversations are lost knowledge. Claude should proactively remind the user to save:
- After 10+ exchanges: suggest "Want me to run /obsidian-save before we continue?"
- When the user signals wrap-up (e.g., "ok", "thanks", "done", "bye", "that's it"): suggest "Before you go - want me to /obsidian-save this conversation?"
- When a logical work block completes (feature shipped, decision made, problem solved): suggest saving
- Never skip the reminder. This is especially critical on Claude Desktop where there's no background agent.

### Search before creating
Before creating any new note, search for an existing one:
```
search(query="keyword from title")
```
Duplicate notes are vault rot. Merge or update instead of creating new.

### Never claim absence from memory, never fabricate
Two failure modes corrupt the vault silently:
- **False absence (most common):** never say "no note exists" or create a note on the assumption none exists without searching exhaustively first - by every plausible name, alias, and folder, listing and grepping, not from memory. When in doubt, over-include and label the uncertainty.
- **Fabrication:** never invent facts, entities, rates, dates, or relationships that were not actually stated. Mark unknowns as `TBD`; an empty section is correct when nothing was said. External claims carry a source URL + recency marker; inferences carry a confidence level.

See the anti-fabrication and search-completeness hard rules in `references/ai-first-rules.md`.

### Match the vault's voice
Read existing notes in the same folder before writing new ones.
Match: frontmatter schema, heading style, list formatting, tone, emoji usage (or lack of it).
Never introduce new conventions - extend what's already there.

### Frontmatter is mandatory
Every note gets frontmatter. At minimum:
```yaml
---
date: 2026-03-24
tags:
  - <note-type>
---
```
See `references/vault-schema.md` for full frontmatter specs by note type.

---

## Write Rules

See `references/write-rules.md` for the complete guide. Summary:

- **Links**: Use `[[Note Name]]` for internal links. Always link to people, projects, and jobs mentioned in a note.
- **Dates**: ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) in frontmatter. Human format (`March 24`) in body text.
- **Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD - Title.md` for dated notes. `Title.md` for evergreen notes. No special characters except the ASCII hyphen `-`. Never an em dash (U+2014) or en dash (U+2013) in a filename: link matching compares stems literally, so `2026-07-26 - Title.md` will not resolve a `[[2026-07-26 - Title]]` link, producing an orphan and a dangling link in the same write. The write-time validator checks file CONTENT, not filenames, so nothing catches this for you.
- **Status values**: `active` / `planning` / `completed` / `archived` / `on-hold` for projects. `in-progress` / `done` / `waiting` for tasks.
- **Kanban**: Items follow the format `- [ ] 🔴 **Title** · @{YYYY-MM-DD}\n\tDescription [[Link]]`

---

## The `_CLAUDE.md` File

This is the most important concept in this skill.

`_CLAUDE.md` lives at the vault root and persists Claude's operating rules across every session and every surface (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VS Code, terminal). Without it, Claude has to re-learn your vault conventions every conversation.

**Precedence rule:** `_CLAUDE.md` wins on all vault-specific rules (folder names, naming conventions, frontmatter fields, auto-save behavior, private folders). The defaults in this skill file apply only where `_CLAUDE.md` is silent. Never let skill defaults override an explicit `_CLAUDE.md` rule.

**What it contains:**
- Your vault's folder map and what each folder is for
- Frontmatter schemas for your specific note types
- Naming conventions you use
- What to auto-save vs. what to ask first
- People and projects that need special handling
- Links to key files (boards, dashboard, templates)

To generate a `_CLAUDE.md` for an existing vault, run vault discovery then use the template in `references/claude-md-template.md`.

To install it: write the file to the vault root. Every Claude session that starts in that vault should read it first.

---

## Common Operations

### Save info from conversation
When a conversation produces something vault-worthy:
1. Identify the note type (decision → project note, person met → People/, task → board + Tasks/, etc.)
2. Check if a relevant note already exists
3. Write or update - always frontmatter-first
4. Propagate to boards, daily note, linked notes

### Create today's daily note
```
date = today in YYYY-MM-DD format
path = Daily/{date}.md
```
Read `Templates/Daily Note.md`, fill in the date fields, create the file.
Then scan recent conversation for anything worth logging in today's sections.

### Log a dev session
Read `Templates/Dev Log.md`. Fill: date, project name, what was worked on, problems solved, decisions made, next steps.
Save to `Dev Logs/YYYY-MM-DD - Project Name.md`.
Link from project note's Recent Activity section and today's daily note.

### Update a kanban board
Boards use the `kanban-plugin: board` frontmatter.
Columns are `## Column Name` headers.
Items are `- [ ] **Title** · @{due-date}\n\tDescription [[Links]]`
Completed items move to the `## ✅ Done` column with a strikethrough: `- [x] ~~**Title**~~ ✅ Date`

### Run vault health check
```bash
uv run --directory "SKILL_ROOT" scripts/vault_health.py --path ~/path/to/vault
```
Reports: duplicate notes, orphaned files (no incoming links), stale tasks (overdue), empty folders, broken links, notes missing frontmatter.

Proactively suggest running this when the user says the vault feels messy, notes are hard to find, they mention duplicates, or they haven't mentioned a health check in a long time. Offer: *"Want me to run a vault health check?"*

---

## Commands

These slash commands can be used in any Claude surface. Each one is smart - it reads context, searches before writing, and propagates everywhere changes belong.

**Name matching:** If a name argument has a typo or is approximate, search the vault for the closest match, show what was found, and confirm with the user before proceeding. Never silently create a note with a misspelled name.

**Command selection: the longest matching trigger wins.** Several triggers are prefixes of longer, more specific ones, so a shorter match is not evidence that the shorter command is the right one. Always check whether a longer trigger also matches before choosing.

The five collisions that exist today, with the correct routing:

| The user says | Route to | Not to | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| "remind me every month...", "track a recurring..." | `/obsidian-recurring` | `/obsidian-task` | A one-shot card never recurs, which is the whole point of the request |
| "save this idea", "capture this" | `/obsidian-capture` | `/obsidian-save` | One small idea note, not a multi-subagent sweep across people, projects, tasks, decisions and boards |
| "save this person", "remember this person" | `/obsidian-person` | `/obsidian-save` | A person note, not a full conversation sweep |
| "synthesize what I know about X" | `/vault-deep-synthesis` | `/obsidian-synthesize` | One topic cross-referenced, not a whole-vault pattern scan |
| "find unnamed patterns" | `/obsidian-emerge` | `/obsidian-synthesize` | Surfaces patterns for the user, does not write synthesis pages unasked |

When two commands still look equally plausible after applying the rule, ask which one rather than guessing - the blast radii differ enormously, and `/obsidian-save` in particular writes across many files.

---

### `/obsidian-save`

**The master save command.** Reads the entire conversation and extracts everything worth preserving.

Steps:
1. Scan the conversation and identify all vault-worthy items: decisions, tasks, people mentioned, projects started, ideas, learnings, deals, mentions/shoutouts
2. Group items by type: people, projects, tasks, decisions, ideas, deals
3. Spawn parallel subagents - one per group - so all note types are handled simultaneously:
   - **People agent**: search for each person, create or update notes, log interactions
   - **Projects agent**: search for each project, create or update notes
   - **Tasks agent**: parse tasks, add to the right kanban columns
   - **Decisions agent**: find relevant project notes, append to Key Decisions sections
   - **Ideas agent**: search Ideas/ for related notes, create or append
4. After all agents complete: update today's daily note with links to everything saved
5. Report back: a clean list of what was saved and where

Do not ask for guidance on where to save things - infer it. Only ask if something is genuinely ambiguous (e.g. a person mentioned with no context on who they are).

---

### `/obsidian-daily`

**Creates or updates today's daily note.** Full steps in `commands/obsidian-daily.md` (the source of truth).

In short: resolves the daily folder per `references/folder-map.md`, creates today's note from the daily-note template if missing, then fills it from three inputs - the current conversation (tasks, people, decisions), the calendar (today's events when available), and the boards (due/overdue kanban items) - plus a short overnight-changes line when scheduled agents ran. Existing notes are injected into, never overwritten. Returns the note path.

---

### `/obsidian-calendar <mode>`

**One calendar command with four modes.** Claude Code only (needs the Google Calendar MCP). The first word selects the mode; a bare range word defaults to `agenda`; no argument at all defaults to `agenda today`.

- **`agenda [range]`** - reads the calendar and writes a re-derivable AI-first snapshot to `wiki/agenda/` (`type: agenda-snapshot`). Range: `today`, `tomorrow`, `week`, `next-week`, a date, or a range. Cross-links attendees to `[[Person]]` notes; flags conflicts, 3+ back-to-back stretches, working-hours focus blocks, and externally-organized events. Read-only on the calendar; Google Calendar stays the source of truth.
- **`reconcile [window]`** - flags commitments the vault implies (project `next_action`s, due tasks, dated commitments in daily notes, fixed dates in `CRITICAL_FACTS.md`) that are NOT on the calendar, plus events with no vault context. Flag only - never adds or changes events.
- **`meeting [selector]`** - turns an event (`last`, `next`, `today`, `event-id:<id>`, or fuzzy title) into a `type: meeting` note in `wiki/meetings/` with metadata pre-filled and **empty** Notes / Decisions / Action items sections (never fabricate meeting content). Cross-links attendees, backlinks any task whose `calendar-event-id` matches.
- **`schedule <args>`** - the only mode that writes to the calendar. Standalone (`"<title>" <when> <duration>`), from a task (`task:<path>`), or suggest-a-time (`task:<...> suggest:<window>`). Resolves attendee emails from person notes (never guesses), conflict-checks before writing, requests a Meet link when participants span domains, and writes `calendar-event-id` back into the task so a re-run reschedules rather than duplicating.

(Consolidated from the former `/obsidian-agenda`, `/obsidian-reconcile`-style calendar check, `/obsidian-meeting`, and `/obsidian-schedule` - same behaviors, one entry point. The natural-language triggers for all four still route here.)

---

### `/obsidian-recurring`

**Tracks a recurring obligation (payment, filing, ops) with a cadence and a computed next-due date.**

State the obligation and cadence (e.g. "pay social benefits, monthly day 20"). Searches for an existing note first, then builds a `type: recurring-task` note with What / Cadence / Blockers / History sections and frontmatter (`cadence`, `owner`, `blocker`, `next-due`, optional `amount`). Adds a board card for the next occurrence; on each completion, appends a History row and advances `next-due`. Fills the gap that `/obsidian-task` (one-shot) leaves.

---

### `/obsidian-log`

**Logs a work or dev session to the vault.** Full steps in `commands/obsidian-log.md` (the source of truth).

In short: infers the project from conversation, uses the dev-log template when one exists (inline structure otherwise), and saves `YYYY-MM-DD - Project Name.md` to the dev-log folder resolved per `references/folder-map.md` (wiki-style `wiki/logs/`, Obsidian-style `Dev Logs/`). Links are injected into the project note's Recent Activity and today's daily note.

---

### `/obsidian-task [description]`

**Adds a task to the vault and the right kanban board.**

Steps:
1. Parse the task from the argument or from recent conversation context if no argument given
2. Infer: priority (🔴/🟡/🟢), due date, linked project, linked person
3. Search for the right kanban board - use `_CLAUDE.md` board list or search `Boards/`
4. Add the task card to the correct column (`📋 This Week` or `📥 Backlog` depending on due date)
5. Create a task note in `Tasks/` if the task is substantial (more than a one-liner)
6. Link the task from the relevant project note and today's daily note

---

### `/obsidian-person [name]`

**Creates or updates a person note.**

Steps:
1. Search the vault for an existing note matching the name (fuzzy - handle typos and partial names)
2. If found: confirm with user, then update with new info from conversation
3. If not found: create `People/Full Name.md` with full frontmatter schema
4. Fill in everything inferable from the conversation: role, company, context, relationship strength, last interaction date
5. Log the interaction in today's daily note
6. If a People index file exists, add or update the entry there

---

### `/obsidian-capture [optional: idea text]`

**Quick idea capture with zero friction.**

Steps:
1. Take the argument as the idea, or pull the most recent idea/thought from the conversation
2. Search `Ideas/` for a related existing note - if found, append to it
3. If new: create `Ideas/Title.md` with minimal frontmatter (`date`, `tags: [idea]`)
4. Write the idea with any supporting context from the conversation
5. Add a brief mention in today's daily note under an Ideas or Captures section

---

### `/obsidian-catchup [today|week|all]`

**Process what the Telegram journal bot captured on the go.** The laptop-side companion to the `integrations/telegram-journal/` bot, which captures voice/text/image/PDF/link from your phone and appends each to a `catchup.md` queue in the vault.

Steps:
1. Read `catchup.md` in the vault root - each unchecked `- [ ]` line is an unprocessed capture (`date time | kind | summary | -> where`).
2. Collect the unchecked items, applying the timeframe filter (`today` / `week` / `all`, default `all`). If none, say so and stop.
3. Show them grouped by age (Today / This week / Older), flagging stale ones.
4. Process WITH the user (not autonomously): open each linked note, propose **integrate** (fold into the right note per the AI-first rule) / **keep** / **discard**, confirm, then write.
5. Check the item off (`- [x]` + processed date); never delete queue history.

Pull, not push: nothing is processed until you run this, so nothing surprises you. The phone is for fast dumb capture; this is where it becomes integrated knowledge.

---

### `/obsidian-find [query]`

**Smart vault search.**

Steps:
1. Run `search(query="...")` with the provided query
2. Also try variations if results are sparse (synonyms, related terms)
3. Return results with context: note title, folder, a relevant excerpt, and what type of note it is
4. If results are ambiguous, group them by type (people, projects, tasks, etc.)
5. Offer to open, update, or link any of the found notes

Do not just return filenames - return enough context for the user to act.

---

### `/obsidian-recap [today|week|month]`

**Summarizes a time period from the vault.**

Steps:
1. Determine the date range from the argument (default: `week` if not specified)
2. List all daily notes in the range with `list_files_in_dir("Daily/")`
3. Spawn parallel subagents - one per daily note - to read and extract key points from each simultaneously
4. Also spawn parallel agents to read dev logs and completed kanban tasks from the same period
5. Synthesize all agent results: what was worked on, decisions made, people interacted with, tasks completed, ideas captured
6. Present as a clean narrative summary - not a raw dump of note content

---

### `/obsidian-review`

**Generates a structured weekly or monthly review note.** Full steps in `commands/obsidian-review.md` (the source of truth).

In short: reads the period's daily notes, dev logs, project changes, and completed board items; drafts from the review template when one exists (accomplishments, key decisions, people, learnings, carry-forward, plus the mandated "Suggested next week/month" section); saves `YYYY-MM-DD - Weekly Review.md` (or Monthly) to the reviews folder resolved per `references/folder-map.md`; links from the period's last daily note.

---

### `/obsidian-board [optional: board name]`

**Shows or updates a kanban board.**

Steps:
1. If a board name is given, search `Boards/` for it (fuzzy match)
2. If no name given, list available boards and ask which one
3. Read and display the current board state: columns, item counts, overdue items (past `@{date}`)
4. Ask if the user wants to make updates - if yes, infer changes from conversation context
5. Move completed items to ✅ Done with strikethrough, add new items in the right column
6. Flag any items that are overdue or have been in the same column for more than a week

---

### `/obsidian-board-hygiene [optional: board name]`

**Bulk-triages a kanban board whose columns have gone stale.** Where `/obsidian-board` only flags overdue items, this clears them.

Steps:
1. Read `_CLAUDE.md` for the boards folder and kanban convention (columns, `@{date}` format)
2. Read the target board (fuzzy-match; if none given, list boards and ask), parse every open item, compute age vs today
3. Group items into overdue (`@{date}` past), stale (older than N days, default 14), and undated; show counts per column so the bloat is visible
4. Propose ONE verdict per stale/overdue item with a one-line reason - done / reschedule / archive / keep - as a batch the user approves, edits, or overrides
5. Apply approved verdicts in place (additive moves + strikethrough, never silent deletion), then report what moved and log it

---

### `/obsidian-project [name]`

**Creates or updates a project note.**

Steps:
1. Search the vault for an existing project matching the name (fuzzy - handle typos)
2. If found: show what was found, confirm, then update with new info from conversation
3. If not found: create `Projects/Project Name.md` with full frontmatter schema (`date`, `tags: [project]`, `status: active`, `job`)
4. Fill in everything inferable from the conversation: description, goals, key people, current status
5. Add a card to the relevant kanban board in the `📥 Backlog` or `🔨 In Progress` column
6. Link from today's daily note

---

### `/obsidian-projects [optional: project name]`

**Live status overview across all tracked projects.**

Reads `_CLAUDE.md` for the projects folder, then scans it for notes with `type: project` or a `repo:` field. For each project, spawns a parallel subagent that runs three checks: reads the vault note (status, last activity, next action, blockers), runs `git log` and `git status` if a `repo:` path is set, and looks for `NOTES.md` / `TODO.md` in the repo root. Merges the three into one status block (active / stalled / idle / blocked / archived inferred from activity recency), prints the full overview to the conversation ordered active-first, then injects a `## Last overview` section into each project note.

If a project name argument is given, shows deep context for that one project only.

---

### `/obsidian-health`

**Runs a vault health check and summarizes findings.**

Steps:
1. Run: `uv run --directory "SKILL_ROOT" scripts/vault_health.py --path ~/path/to/vault --json`
2. Parse the JSON output and split findings into categories
3. Spawn parallel subagents to handle each category simultaneously:
   - **Links agent**: verify broken links, attempt to resolve them
   - **Duplicates agent**: confirm duplicates are truly the same concept, not just similar names
   - **Frontmatter agent**: identify notes missing required fields by type
   - **Staleness agent**: check overdue tasks and unfilled template syntax
   - **Orphans agent**: check orphaned notes and empty folders
   - **Contradictions agent**: scan Key Decisions and Knowledge/ for claims that conflict or are superseded
   - **Concept gaps agent**: find terms mentioned 3+ times without a dedicated page
   - **Stale claims agent**: flag Knowledge/ notes older than 6 months on fast-moving topics
   - **Freshness agent**: run `python scripts/freshness_lint.py --path <vault> --json` - enforces `references/freshness-policy.md` (every stored fact must be timeless, dated, or a pointer; fast facts carry an `as of` stamp or link to their home system)
   - **Typed-edge lint agent**: run `python scripts/link_graph.py --path <vault> --lint` - validates the `relations:` typed-edge graph (Rule 6 § Typed edges in `references/ai-first-rules.md`): contradiction cycles (critical), unknown types / dangling targets / self-edges (warning), missing inverse edges (info). Returns zero findings on vaults that use no typed edges yet
4. Merge agent results and group by severity:
   - 🔴 Critical: broken links, unfilled template syntax, contradictions, typed-edge contradiction cycles
   - 🟡 Warning: duplicates, stale tasks, missing frontmatter, stale claims, concept gaps, typed-edge problems (unknown type, dangling target, self-edge)
   - ⚪ Info: orphaned notes, empty folders, missing inverse edges
5. Present a clean summary with counts per category
6. For safe fixes (missing frontmatter, obvious duplicates, creating pages for concept gaps), offer to fix them automatically
7. For destructive fixes (archiving, merging, resolving contradictions), list them and ask for explicit confirmation before touching anything
8. Append an operation-log entry with severity counts - if `Logs/` exists write the entry to `Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, otherwise append to `log.md` (SKILL.md's own rule: the root `log.md` is a pointer file in v0.9+ vaults, never an entry target)

---

### `/obsidian-reindex`

**Refreshes the semantic search index and makes its coverage visible.** Full steps in `commands/obsidian-reindex.md` (the source of truth).

In short: reads the vault path from `_CLAUDE.md`, reports the current `index_coverage`, runs the existing incremental `semantic_search.py --build`, and reports coverage again with the builder's new, cached, excluded, degraded, and dropped counts. A backend failure stops the flow and is shown to the user; it is never presented as a successful refresh. The command updates only `.obsidian-semantic-index.json`, not Markdown notes.

---

### `/obsidian-retrieval-eval [optional: N to generate | report]`

**Measures how well vault search actually finds the right note - so improving retrieval is a number, not a hunch.**

Hybrid command backed by `scripts/eval/retrieval_eval.py`, which reuses the REAL search engine (`integrations/obsidian-mcp-server/vault_ops.py`, the term-frequency, title-weighted ranking behind `/obsidian-find` and the MCP connector). It bootstraps its own eval set from the vault (an LLM writes a question per sampled note, avoiding the note's title words so it tests retrieval not string-match; the note is the gold answer), then scores recall@1/3/5/10 and MRR and lists the failures - misses and notes buried below #3, naming which note wrongly ranked #1. Claude interprets the numbers, turns failures into ranked retrieval fixes (each a hypothesis to re-measure on the same cases), and optionally writes an AI-first baseline note. Generated cases hold private note paths and are gitignored. The first run on a 1,000+ note vault scored **0% recall@10** on paraphrased questions (long `raw/` transcripts and `log.md` dominate term-frequency ranking) - proving the cheap structural fixes (exclude `raw/`, weight by `type:`) should be measured before reaching for a vector index.

---

### `/obsidian-reconcile`

**Finds and resolves contradictions across the vault.**

Steps:
1. Read `index.md` to understand the full vault landscape
2. Spawn parallel subagents to find contradictions:
   - **Claims agent**: scan `wiki/concepts/` and `wiki/projects/` for conflicting factual claims
   - **Entity agent**: scan `wiki/entities/` for outdated roles, companies, or descriptions
   - **Decisions agent**: scan `wiki/decisions/` for reversed or superseded decisions never updated
   - **Source freshness agent**: compare `raw/` dates against `wiki/` pages for stale references
3. For each contradiction, evaluate: which is newer, which is more authoritative, is it a genuine conflict or an evolution
4. Resolve:
   - **Clear winner**: rewrite the outdated page, add a History section noting what changed
   - **Ambiguous**: create `wiki/decisions/Conflict - Topic.md` with both sides, mark `status: open`
   - **Evolution**: update the page to current state with historical context
5. Rebuild affected `index.md` sections, append an operation-log entry (if `Logs/` exists write the entry to `Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, otherwise append to `log.md` (SKILL.md's own rule: the root `log.md` is a pointer file in v0.9+ vaults, never an entry target)), update daily note

---

### `/obsidian-synthesize`

**Automatic synthesis - the vault thinks for itself.**

Can run manually or as a scheduled agent. Scans the vault for patterns nobody asked about.

Steps:
1. Read `index.md` and `log.md` (last 20 entries) for recent activity
2. Spawn parallel subagents:
   - **Cross-source agent**: find concepts appearing in 2+ unrelated sources from the last 7 days
   - **Entity convergence agent**: find people who appear together in multiple contexts but have no connection page
   - **Concept evolution agent**: find concepts updated 3+ times and document how thinking changed
   - **Orphan rescue agent**: find unlinked notes that should be connected to existing pages
3. For each pattern: create `wiki/concepts/Synthesis - Title.md` with evidence, interpretation, and suggested action
4. Link synthesis pages FROM all source notes they reference
5. Update `index.md`, `log.md`, and today's daily note

---

### `/obsidian-export`

**Export a clean snapshot any agent or tool can consume.** Full steps in `commands/obsidian-export.md` (the source of truth).

In short: three formats - flat JSON (default, `_export/vault-snapshot.json`), a markdown index, or an OKF bundle (Open Knowledge Format, via `uv run scripts/export_okf.py`) that makes the vault readable by any OKF-speaking agent. Scans every note folder present (enumerated per `references/folder-map.md`, both vault styles), extracting path, title, type, date, status, summary, links, tags. Appends to the operation log.

---

### `/obsidian-init`

**Bootstraps the vault's operating surfaces: `_CLAUDE.md`, `index.md`, the log setup, and Bases.** Full steps in `commands/obsidian-init.md` (the source of truth).

In short: maps the vault (parallel subagents over the dashboard, templates, boards, and sample notes), generates `_CLAUDE.md` from `references/claude-md-template.md` with real values, writes `index.md` (the catalog) and the operation-log setup (per-day `Logs/` with a `log.md` pointer, or monolithic `log.md`), and stamps the `Bases/` live views from `references/bases/*.template` with the vault's folder names. Files are written with your file tools (or `obsidian_save_note` on MCP clients). Tell the user to restart the session afterwards.

If `_CLAUDE.md` already exists: show a diff of what would change and ask before overwriting.

---

### `/obsidian-architect`

**Scans a codebase and writes a maintained set of architecture notes into the vault - overview, per-module notes, key decisions. Re-runnable.**

Hybrid command: `scripts/architect_scan.py` does a deterministic scan (stack, modules, dependencies, entry points, git commit) and emits JSON; Claude synthesizes the prose, rationale, a Mermaid diagram, and likely personas, then writes AI-first notes under `Projects/<name>/Architecture/` (`type: architecture-overview` + `type: architecture-module`). Pulls decision candidates from `scripts/mine_commit_decisions.py`. Refresh is the same command re-run: it uses sentinel markers (`<!-- @generated -->` / `<!-- @user -->`, see `references/write-rules.md`) so re-running updates only the generated blocks and never clobbers your hand-edits. For builders who want their code projects documented in the same brain as their ideas and decisions.

---

### `/obsidian-visualize [scope]`

**Generates a JSON Canvas map of the vault's knowledge graph, openable in Obsidian's native canvas viewer.**

Backed by `scripts/link_graph.py` (deterministic link extraction - no whole-vault read). Optional scope: a project, entity, topic, or `full` (default). Builds nodes and edges from `[[wikilinks]]`, clusters by type (entities, projects, concepts, daily, sources) with color and size keyed to centrality, flags orphans with a red border, and writes `atlas.canvas` (or `atlas-<topic>.canvas`) to the vault root. Also emits a text summary: hub nodes by degree centrality, bridge nodes, stale orphans, clusters, and any centrality skew (a single navigation point of failure). Reads the `typed_edges` overlay (from `relations:` frontmatter) to label canvas edges with their relation type and surface the longest `supersedes`/`depends_on`/`caused` reasoning chains. Appends a one-line entry to the operation log.

**Typed edges (graph engineering).** Beyond untyped `[[wikilinks]]`, notes can record *typed* relationships in a `relations:` frontmatter block - `supersedes`, `depends_on`, `caused`, `decided_by`, `relates_to`, `contradicts` (each with an inverse). This makes the graph traversable by meaning, not just adjacency. `scripts/link_graph.py` extracts them as a semantic overlay and `--lint` validates them (unknown types, dangling targets, contradiction cycles, missing inverses); `/obsidian-health` runs that lint. The full spec is Rule 6 § Typed edges in `references/ai-first-rules.md`. The overlay is always reconstructed from frontmatter on demand - plain markdown, no separate graph store.

---

### `/create-command [seed]`

**Scaffolds a new obsidian-second-brain command through a short interview - no markdown or frontmatter editing.**

A guided conversation (intent, name, category, trigger phrases, behavior steps, AI-first compliance, external APIs) writes a fully-formed `commands/<name>.md` that the build pipeline picks up on the next `bash scripts/build.sh`, flowing into all seven platform builds. The optional seed pre-fills suggestions. Every command created this way lands AI-first-compliant by construction. (This is the command that creates commands; it does not run on itself.)

---

### `/obsidian-ingest`

**Ingests a source into the vault - one source touches many pages.**

Steps:
1. Accept a URL, file path, or pasted text as the source
2. Classify the source type before full read: article, PDF, transcript, video, or raw text
3. Read or fetch the full source content
4. Extract: entities (people, companies, tools), concepts, claims, action items, notable quotes
5. Save the raw source to `Knowledge/YYYY-MM-DD - Source Title.md` with full summary and source link
6. Spawn parallel subagents to distribute knowledge across the vault:
   - **People agent**: create or update People/ notes for each person mentioned
   - **Projects agent**: update existing project notes with new findings
   - **Ideas agent**: create or append to Ideas/ for new concepts
   - **Knowledge agent**: create or update Knowledge/ notes for factual claims and frameworks
7. Update `index.md` with all newly created notes
8. Append an operation-log entry: if `Logs/` exists write `**HH:MM** - ingest | Source Title (type) - X created, Y updated` to `Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`; otherwise append `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Source Title (type) - X created, Y updated` to `log.md`
9. Update today's daily note with an ingest summary

A single ingest should touch 5-15 files. Compile knowledge once, distribute everywhere.

---

### `/obsidian-decide [topic] [--formal]`

**Records decisions at two depths.** Default mode captures the decisions made in a conversation as dated one-liners appended to the relevant project notes' `## Key Decisions` sections (and the daily note) - for the steady stream of choices made while working. `--formal` (or leading with `adr`) instead writes one full Architecture Decision Record - Decision / Context / Options Considered / Rationale / Consequences / Related - to the decisions folder (resolved per `references/folder-map.md`: wiki-style `wiki/decisions/`, Obsidian-style `Knowledge/`), links it from the project's Key Decisions and `index.md`, and logs it. Use the formal mode for a structural or directional decision worth a real writeup; `python scripts/mine_commit_decisions.py` surfaces decision-shaped commits as ADR candidates.

The vault knows why it's structured the way it is - when a future session asks "why?", the formal record answers. `/obsidian-graduate`, `/obsidian-health` structural fixes, and folder reorganizations may offer to write a formal record; they offer, they don't force.

(Consolidated: the former standalone `/obsidian-adr` is now `/obsidian-decide --formal`; its triggers still route here.)

---

### `/obsidian-learn [recent|all|topic]`

**Reviews the lessons scattered across the vault and turns them into a living rulebook.**

Scans daily notes, dev logs, ADRs, and auto-generated pattern reports for lessons, mistakes, and wins, then classifies each as active, stale, superseded, or a promotion candidate (appeared 3+ times - worth becoming a permanent rule in `_CLAUDE.md`). Default scope is the last 30 days (`all` for the whole vault, or a named topic). Writes a Learnings Review to `wiki/concepts/YYYY-MM-DD - Learnings Review.md` and offers to promote candidates or archive stale lessons with confirmation. Lessons that are not reviewed do not compound.

---

## Thinking Tools

These commands use the vault as a thinking partner - not just storage. They surface insights, challenge assumptions, and generate connections that the user cannot see on their own.

---

### `/obsidian-brainstorm`

**Multi-turn Socratic brainstorm - the only stateful thinking tool.**

Every other thinking tool is a single-shot analytical pass; this one interviews the user one question per turn (multiple-choice preferred) across six categories - problem framing, constraints, trade-off forcing, scope bounding, prior-decision linking, anti-goals - until an internal 6-item convergence checklist reaches at least 5, then presents 2-3 named approaches with exactly one (Recommended), and writes a `type: brainstorm` note (conclusions and reasoning, never the transcript). Grounds its questions in the vault first: related decisions, contradictions, and open questions become interview material. Offers `/obsidian-graduate` or `/obsidian-decide` when the outcome is project- or ADR-shaped. Full flow in `commands/obsidian-brainstorm.md`.

---

### `/obsidian-challenge`

**Red-teams your current idea against your own vault history.**

Steps:
1. Identify the user's current claim, plan, or assumption - from the argument or conversation context
2. Extract the key premises behind that position
3. Spawn parallel subagents to search for counter-evidence:
   - **Decisions agent**: search Key Decisions sections for past decisions that contradicted similar thinking
   - **Failures agent**: search dev logs, daily notes, and archives for past failures or lessons related to this topic
   - **Contradictions agent**: search for notes where the user held the opposite position or flagged risks
4. Synthesize a structured "Red Team" analysis:
   - **Your position**: restate the claim
   - **Counter-evidence from your vault**: cite specific notes, dates, and quotes
   - **Blind spots**: what the user might be ignoring based on their own history
   - **Verdict**: consistent with past experience, or does the vault suggest caution?
5. Log the challenge in today's daily note under a Thinking section

Do not be agreeable. The entire point is to pressure-test. Cite specific vault files.

---

### `/obsidian-emerge`

**Surfaces unnamed patterns from recent notes - recurring themes and conclusions you haven't explicitly stated.**

Steps:
1. Determine the date range from the argument (default: last 30 days)
2. Spawn parallel subagents to scan vault content:
   - **Daily notes agent**: extract recurring topics, complaints, observations, energy patterns
   - **Dev logs agent**: extract repeated blockers, tools, architectural patterns
   - **Decisions agent**: look for directional trends across project notes
   - **Ideas agent**: look for thematic clusters in Ideas/ notes
3. Identify:
   - **Recurring themes**: topics that appeared 3+ times without being named as a priority
   - **Emotional patterns**: what energizes vs. drains (based on language)
   - **Unnamed conclusions**: things the notes imply but never state outright
   - **Emerging directions**: where the vault suggests the user is heading
4. Present a "Pattern Report" - each pattern with evidence (cited notes), interpretation, and suggested action
5. Offer to save the report to `Ideas/` or a relevant project note
6. Log a summary in today's daily note

The goal is insight the user cannot see themselves. Surface what they haven't named yet.

---

### `/obsidian-connect [topic A] [topic B]`

**Bridges two unrelated domains using the vault's link graph to spark new ideas.**

Steps:
1. Parse two domains from arguments (e.g., `/obsidian-connect "distributed systems" "cooking"`)
2. For each domain, search the vault: find all related notes, map backlinks and outgoing links to build a local cluster
3. Find the bridge:
   - Shared links, tags, or people between the two clusters
   - If a direct path exists in the link graph, trace it and explain each hop
   - If no direct path, find the closest semantic overlap
4. Generate creative connections:
   - **Structural analogy**: how a pattern in A maps to B
   - **Transfer opportunities**: what works in A that could apply to B
   - **Collision ideas**: new concepts that only exist at the intersection
5. Present 3-5 specific, actionable connections - not vague analogies but concrete ideas
6. Offer to save the best connections to `Ideas/` with links to both source domains
7. Log the connection exercise in today's daily note

The value is in unexpected links. If the connection is obvious, dig deeper.

---

### `/obsidian-graduate`

**Promotes an idea fragment into a full project spec with tasks, board entries, and structure.**

Steps:
1. If argument given: search `Ideas/`, daily notes, and captures for a matching idea (fuzzy)
2. If no argument: list recent ideas (last 14 days) and ask the user to pick one
3. Read the full idea note and any linked notes for context
4. Research the vault for related content: overlapping projects, related people, past decisions, similar ideas explored before
5. Generate a full project spec:
   - **Project note** in `Projects/` with complete frontmatter (status: planning, linked idea)
   - **Goals**: 3-5 concrete outcomes
   - **Key tasks**: broken into phases with priorities
   - **Open questions**: what still needs answering
   - **Related notes**: links to everything relevant
6. Add cards to the relevant kanban board
7. Update the original idea note: add `status: graduated` and link to the new project
8. Link the new project from today's daily note

The idea doesn't die - it evolves. The original note stays as the origin story.

---

### `/obsidian-panel`

**Convenes a panel of distinct perspectives on a decision - one independent verdict per lens, then a synthesis.**

A multi-persona complement to `/obsidian-challenge` (which red-teams from one stance). Uses the vault's `Advisors/` persona notes as panelists if they exist, otherwise four generic lenses (skeptic, user, operator, long-game). Each panelist argues independently before the synthesis; the disagreement is the point and is never hidden. Saves a `type: synthesis` note to `wiki/concepts/`.

---

### `/vault-deep-synthesis [topic]`

**Cross-references everything the vault knows about one topic: agreements, contradictions, stale claims, coverage gaps.**

Topic-driven (unlike `/obsidian-synthesize`, which scans the whole vault unprompted). Pure vault, no network. Greps and reads every note touching the topic, then consolidates into what the vault agrees on, where notes contradict (surfaced, not resolved - that is `/obsidian-reconcile`), what looks stale, and what is missing. Saves a `type: synthesis` note; never modifies the sources.

---

### `/obsidian-distill [note or source]`

**Condenses one source into key claims, each tagged with provenance back to the exact block it came from.** A distillation, not a summary: condensed enough to read fast, anchored enough to audit.

Segments the source into numbered, citable blocks (`B1`, `B2`, ...), extracts the key claims, and tags each claim with the block(s) it came from (`(src: B3)`). A claim with no traceable source does not make the cut - and gets reported as dropped, never silently cut. Inferences the source implies but never states go in a separate labelled section so distilled fact and reasoning never blur. Saves a `type: distillation` note (with the verbatim `source` and the numbered source blocks at the bottom), links it from the original. This is the trust primitive for a vault more than one person reads - the differentiator behind the team-vault direction. Pairs with `/obsidian-ingest` (brings the source in) and `/vault-deep-synthesis` (cross-references many notes).

---

### `/idea-discovery`

**Ranks 3-5 next-direction candidates from ungraduated ideas, open project questions, and orphan research.**

Answers "what is worth doing next" from vault material. Distinct from `/obsidian-emerge` (names unstated patterns) and `/obsidian-graduate` (promotes one chosen idea). Ranks candidates by a stated heuristic (recency, pull, momentum) and gives the smallest next step for each. Does not auto-graduate.

---

## Context Engine

### `/obsidian-world`

**Loads your identity, values, priorities, and current state in one shot - with progressive context levels.**

Uses token budgets to avoid loading the entire vault. Start light, go deeper only as needed.

Steps:
1. **L0 - Identity (~200 tokens)**: read `SOUL.md`/`About Me.md` and `CORE_VALUES.md`/`Values.md`
2. **L1 - Navigation (~1-2K tokens)**: read `index.md` (vault catalog) and `log.md` (last 10 entries)
3. **L2 - Current State (~2-5K tokens)**: read `Home.md`/`Dashboard.md`, today's daily note, last 3 daily notes, active kanban boards, previous session digests
4. **L3 - Deep Context (on demand, ~5-20K tokens)**: only load if needed - active project notes, full Knowledge/ articles, recently mentioned people

Present a brief status after L0-L2 (do NOT load L3 unless needed):
- **Who I am to you**: persona and communication style
- **Your current priorities**: top 3-5 active threads (from index.md + boards)
- **Open threads from last session**: anything unfinished (from log.md + daily notes)
- **Overdue / needs attention**: stale tasks or projects
- **Today so far**: what's already logged

Keep output concise - this is a boot-up sequence, not a report.

If identity files don't exist, offer to create them by asking 5-7 quick questions about the user's role, values, and preferences.
If `index.md` doesn't exist, offer to run `/obsidian-init` to generate it.

---

## Research Commands

Seven commands that pull external knowledge into the vault - X posts, X discourse, web research with citations, vault-grounded synthesis, YouTube videos, and podcast episodes (plus `/obsidian-ingest` above for arbitrary URLs, PDFs, audio, and screenshots). All output AI-first notes per the vault's Section 0 rule (preamble, rich frontmatter, recency markers, mandatory wikilinks, sources verbatim).

**Setup:** API keys live at `~/.config/obsidian-second-brain/.env`. Run `install.sh` and answer "y" to the research toolkit prompt, or copy `.env.example` manually. The xAI Grok key is required for `/x-read` and `/x-pulse`. Perplexity is optional: with no `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` set, `/research` and `/research-deep` fall back to free key-less sources automatically, and `--free` forces that path even when a key exists (`--academic` restricts it to scholarly sources). YouTube key is optional; transcripts work without it. Never tell a user a research command is unavailable because they lack a Perplexity key.

**Stack:** Python 3.10+ with `uv`. Install deps via `uv sync` from the repo root.

---

### `/x-read [url]`

**Deep-read an X post** via Grok + Live Search. Verbatim post + thread + TL;DR + key claims + reply sentiment + voices to watch.

Steps:
1. Validate the URL contains `x.com/` or `twitter.com/`
2. Run `uv run -m scripts.research.x_read "<url>"` from the repo root
3. Show the structured analysis verbatim to the user
4. **Default save: chat only.** If the user asks "save this", write an AI-first note to `Research/X-reads/`

Plain English triggers: "read this tweet", "analyze this X post", "what's in this tweet".

---

### `/x-pulse [topic]`

**Scan X for what's trending** in a topic. Themes (with rep posts + voices), gaps, hooks working, voice/tone, post ideas.

Steps:
1. Resolve the topic (multi-word fine)
2. Run `uv run -m scripts.research.x_pulse "<topic>"`
3. Show the pulse output verbatim
4. **Default save: auto-saves** to `Research/X-pulse/YYYY-MM-DD - <slug>.md` (AI-first format)
5. Append a one-line operation-log entry - if `Logs/` exists write the entry to `Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, otherwise append to `log.md` (SKILL.md's own rule: the root `log.md` is a pointer file in v0.9+ vaults, never an entry target)

Plain English: "what's hot on X about AI", "X pulse on vibe coding", "what should I post today on AI automation".

### `/research [topi

…（正文过长，已截断，完整版见仓库）
