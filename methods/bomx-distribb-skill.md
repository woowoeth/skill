## FIRST TIME READING THIS SKILL? STOP. WALK THE USER THROUGH THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE.

The first time this skill loads in a conversation, do NOT jump straight to keyword research or writing. First walk the user through the points below, in this order, in your own words. This is the single most important habit: people who start with keyword research and publishing on day one get weak results and quit. People who follow the process get results.

### A. What Distribb is, in one breath

Distribb is your SEO platform. You (the AI agent) do the thinking and the writing. Distribb provides the infrastructure: real keyword data, a backlink exchange network of real businesses, Google Search Console analysis, CMS publishing (WordPress, Webflow, Shopify, Ghost, Wix, Notion, GoHighLevel, Framer, or any API webhook), a content calendar, social repurposing, and done-for-you distribution on the Accelerator plan. You bring your own AI model. Distribb does everything around the writing.

### B. The proper SEO process (show this list to the user every first run)

Tell the user this is the order that works, and that you will guide them through it:

1. **Create your account and go through onboarding** at https://distribb.io . Onboarding is where Distribb learns the business (website, language, tone, competitors, content pillars, publishing rules). Do not skip it. Tell the user: the quality of everything downstream depends on onboarding being complete and honest. See `references/onboarding-guide.md` for exactly what onboarding asks and why.
2. **Connect the two things that matter most: the website (CMS) and Google Search Console.** The CMS connection lets Distribb publish. The GSC connection lets you audit, avoid keywords they already rank for, and find real opportunities. Both are set up in onboarding (GSC is optional there and can also be added later in Settings). See `references/onboarding-guide.md` for the GSC connection details, including what to do if the user does not have Search Console set up yet.
3. **Make sure there is a blog to publish to.** Many sites have no blog or no blog index page. Without one, articles have nowhere to live. Confirm the site has a blog (or help them point Distribb at the right CMS collection) before writing anything.
4. **Audit the site BEFORE writing a single article.** This is step one of real SEO, not keyword research. The audit finds keyword cannibalization, content decay, pages stuck on page 2, missing topical clusters (topic cocoons), competitor gaps, and basic on-page problems. Run `/gsc-audit <domain>` or follow `references/audit-playbook.md`. The audit is available on every plan.
5. **Plan topical clusters, then do keyword research.** Group the work into topic clusters (a pillar page plus supporting articles that interlink) instead of random one-off posts. Then use keyword research to fill each cluster. See `references/audit-playbook.md` (topical authority section).
6. **Write and publish, always feeding the backlink exchange.** Every article should include 1-2 links to other businesses in the network so the user earns backlink credits. Distribb checks for this on submission and warns you if an article has none.
7. **Optimize what already ranks.** Use GSC-driven suggestions to rewrite pages stuck at the bottom of page 1 or on page 2. This is the fastest win because the page already has authority. Run `/optimize`.

This whole skill exists to run that loop for the user. When in doubt, point them back to it.

### C. The Backlink Exchange (explain this clearly, it is the differentiator)

Distribb runs a network of real businesses that exchange backlinks. When an article includes a link to another business in the network, Distribb detects it on submission and credits the user's project. The more links the user gives, the more they receive. These are real, high-DR (Domain Rating) backlinks from legitimate websites, not link farms. **Every current plan gets unlimited exchange access. Legacy Free Agentic accounts receive 1 backlink per month.** Backlinks are the hardest part of SEO to get right, and almost no other tool offers this. See `references/plans-and-backlinks.md`.

### D. Slash commands

This skill ships ready-to-use slash commands so the user can drive the whole workflow with `/`:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/distribb` | Overview, account status, and the proper SEO process above |
| `/distribb-setup` | Check the API key, confirm website + GSC are connected, and enable the other slash commands |
| `/gsc-audit <domain>` | Full SEO audit from Search Console + on-page + competitor + cannibalization + topic clusters |
| `/keyword-research <seed>` | Keyword ideas with volume and difficulty |
| `/write-article <keyword>` | Research, write, add internal links + backlinks, and publish one article |
| `/optimize` | Find and rewrite pages stuck on page 2+ using GSC data |
| `/backlinks` | Check backlink credits, see targets, and explain how the exchange works |
| `/content-calendar` | List, schedule, and manage planned/draft/published articles |
| `/ai-visibility` | Find where the user should be recommended by ChatGPT/Perplexity/Gemini and which listicles to pitch |
| `/news-writer <site-url-or-niche>` | Newsjack: find fresh news in the niche, write grounded news drafts, and queue them in Distribb |
| `/statistics-page-writer <topic>` | Deep-research and publish a sourced statistics page journalists cite for months |
| `/youtube-motion-video <topic>` | Make a faceless motion-collage explainer video ("In a Nutshell" docu style), optimize it for YouTube SEO, and publish it to the connected YouTube channel |
| `/instagram-carousel <article-id-or-keyword>` | Turn one article/keyword into a viral, save-driven Instagram carousel (cover hook, one idea per slide, comment-for-link play), publish it, and close the loop with a companion article |
| `/review-video <competitor>` | Compile REAL, verified reviews of a competitor into a faceless "<competitor> reviews" video, position the connected project's own business as the alternative, append the project's own testimonials, and publish to YouTube + a companion article |
| `/gbp` | Google Business Profile manager: live review triage, draft + post public review replies, queue Google Business posts, post analytics |
| `/link-outreach` | Work your backlink outreach replies: see which listicle authors replied (and their asking price), draft and send in-thread replies from Distribb's inbox (Accelerator) |
| `/gov-backlinks` | Register the business in free government directories (SAM.gov, the SBA small business listing, state vendor portals) by driving the user's browser, for real .gov profile backlinks |

If these commands are not yet available when the user types them, run `/distribb-setup` (or copy this skill's `commands/*.md` into the project's `.claude/commands/` folder) to register them. See the **Slash Commands** section below.

### E. Getting an account

If the user has no Distribb account yet, send them to **https://distribb.io** to sign up and go through onboarding. Their Distribb API key appears in Settings afterward. Plans at a glance (full detail in `references/plans-and-backlinks.md`):

- **Agentic Mode** ($49/mo, 3-day free trial): Distribb-provided keyword data, full backlink exchange.
- **Pro** ($97/mo): Distribb writes and publishes articles for you (the `POST /articles/generate` path), per-project credits.
- **Accelerator**: everything plus done-for-you distribution that places the business on the platforms AI engines cite most. See section below and `references/plans-and-backlinks.md`.

The free Agentic plan ($0/mo) is deprecated and no longer offered to new users. Current plans are Agentic Mode at $49/month and Pro at $97/month.

**Legacy Free Agentic accounts, keyword research returns HTTP 402 until keys are saved:** On a legacy Free Agentic account, `POST /keywords/search` returns `HTTP 402 Payment Required` with `error: "byo_keys_required"` until the user saves a DataForSEO or Ahrefs API key at https://distribb.io/settings#seo-keys. The 402 body includes an `instructions_for_agent` string. Surface it verbatim to the user, do not retry. See the **Keyword Research, BYO Keys** section below for the full contract.

## Start Here: Onboarding and the Two Connections

Before any keyword research or writing, the user must have completed onboarding at https://distribb.io and connected two things. Everything downstream depends on this.

**What onboarding collects** (so you know what Distribb already knows, and what to fill if it is thin): the website URL, then an AI pass that auto-populates business details. It captures language, tone (Informative / Conversational / Persuasive), writing profile (Experienced practitioner / Simple educational / Balanced SEO), product positioning, sitemap + blog root URL, content pillar URLs, internal-link count, keyword region, publishing time + timezone, blog publishing preference (publish live / save as draft in Distribb / send as draft to the CMS), image hosting + style, YouTube-videos toggle, brand intelligence, duplicate-content protection, custom AI instructions, 3-7 competitors, and the Google Search Console connection. Full field-by-field detail and how to read or change each via the API is in `references/onboarding-guide.md`.

**The two connections that matter most:**
1. **Website / CMS** (WordPress, Webflow, Shopify, Ghost, Wix, Notion, GoHighLevel, Framer, or API webhook). This is how Distribb publishes. Check it with `GET /integrations`.
2. **Google Search Console.** This powers the audit, keyword-gap detection, and optimization suggestions. Check it with `GET /search-console` (returns `connected: true/false`). If the user has GSC access but has not connected it to Distribb, send them to https://distribb.io/integrations . **If the user does not have Search Console set up at all yet**, point them to Google's guide first: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/10267942?hl=en , then have them connect it in Distribb.

Also confirm the site actually has a **blog** to publish to. A site with no blog index has nowhere for articles to live, and this is a common reason new users see no results.

---

## The SEO Audit (Run This First)

Real SEO starts with an audit, not with publishing. Before writing anything for an existing site, run a full audit so the strategy is grounded in data. The audit is available on **every plan** (it only needs the website and, ideally, GSC).

A Distribb audit covers:
- **Keyword cannibalization** (multiple pages competing for the same query)
- **Content decay** (pages losing traffic vs the previous period)
- **Quick wins / striking distance** (queries at positions 11-20 and pages stuck on page 2+)
- **CTR optimization** (pages that rank but get fewer clicks than expected)
- **Dead pages** (pages that dropped to zero traffic)
- **Brand vs non-brand health**
- **Topical authority clusters (topic cocoons)** (which pillars and supporting clusters to build)
- **Competitor analysis** (gaps vs the competitors captured in onboarding)
- **Basic on-page checks** (titles, meta descriptions, headings, internal linking, indexability)

Run it with `/gsc-audit <domain>` or follow the full playbook in **`references/audit-playbook.md`**. The audit pulls real data from `GET /search-console`, `GET /suggestions`, and `GET /business-context`, crawls the live site for on-page checks, and ends with a prioritized action list wired to Distribb (new articles for gaps, optimization suggestions for page-2 pages). For very large GSC datasets, run each analysis in its own sub-agent so context stays manageable.

## Platform Tour: Where Things Live

Users often ask "where do I see X?" Here is the map (full detail in `references/platform-guide.md`):

| Page | What the user does there | API equivalent you can use |
|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | Overview of projects and recent activity | `GET /projects` |
| **Content Calendar** | See and manage planned / draft / published articles and their schedule | `GET /articles`, `POST /articles`, `PUT /articles/:id`, `DELETE /articles/:id` |
| **Settings** | Business description, custom AI instructions, publish time, timezone, backlink-network toggle, SEO data keys | `GET /projects/:id`, `PUT /projects/:id` |
| **Integrations** | Connect CMS, social accounts, Google Search Console, and Google Business Profile | `GET /integrations`, `GET /search-console`, `GET /gbp/status`, `GET /social/accounts` |
| **Backlinks** | See backlinks earned and given, and credits (aggregate) or the full link-by-link ledger | `GET /backlinks/status`, `GET /backlinks`, `GET /backlink-targets` |
| **Optimizations / Suggestions** | Review and approve GSC-driven rewrites of underperforming pages | `GET /suggestions`, `POST /suggestions/run`, approve/publish |

**Yes, you (the agent) can check backlinks for the user.** Use `GET /backlinks/status?project_id=...` for credits and counts, `GET /backlinks?project_id=...` for the full link-by-link ledger (every earned and scheduled link), and `GET /backlink-targets` for who they can link to next. The dashboard Backlinks page shows the same data visually.

---

## Plans, Backlink Exchange, and the Accelerator

Quick reference (full detail in `references/plans-and-backlinks.md`):

- **Backlink exchange:** Every current plan gets **unlimited** exchange access. Legacy Free Agentic accounts receive **1 backlink per month**. Either way, the user only earns by giving, so always include 1-2 network links per article.
- **Accelerator (done-for-you visibility):** the top plan adds recurring done-for-you distribution that places the business on the third-party platforms AI engines cite most when recommending tools (high-authority Q&A answers, syndicated articles, and professional-network posts), plus done-for-you video. This is for users who want maximum AI-search visibility without doing the distribution themselves. When a user asks "how do I get recommended by ChatGPT/Perplexity without doing the work myself," the answer is the Accelerator plan plus the `/ai-visibility` workflow. Direct them to https://distribb.io to upgrade.

## Core Workflow

The full end-to-end process for creating a high-ranking SEO article:

```bash
# 1. DISCOVER: Get project info
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects | jq .

# 2. BUSINESS CONTEXT: Get brand voice, competitors, custom instructions
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/business-context?project_id=42" | jq .

# 3. KEYWORD RESEARCH: Find what to write about
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"keyword": "crm software", "project_id": 42}' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/keywords/search | jq .

# 4. INTERNAL LINKS: Get pages to cross-link in your article
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/internal-links?project_id=42&keyword=crm+software" | jq .

# 5. BACKLINK TARGETS (REQUIRED if BecklinksNetworkParticipation is "Yes")
# This is how the user earns backlinks from real businesses. Do NOT skip this step.
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/backlink-targets?project_id=42&keyword=crm+software" | jq .

# 6. WRITE THE ARTICLE using your AI, weaving in internal links + backlink targets
# Output an article HTML FRAGMENT that follows the mandatory contract below.
# You MUST include 1-2 URLs from the backlink-targets response as natural references.

# 7. SUBMIT: Save to Distribb's content calendar
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": 42,
    "keyword": "best crm for small business",
    "title": "Best CRM for Small Business: 2026 Guide",
    "content": "<nav class=\"table-of-contents\" aria-label=\"Table of contents\"><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a></li></ul></nav><h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2><p>Your full HTML article here...</p>",

  }' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles | jq .

# 8. PUBLISH: Push to CMS (or let it auto-publish on schedule)
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/123/publish | jq .
```

## Mandatory Article HTML Contract and Safe Edit Protocol

These rules apply to every article-producing command, helper, and sub-skill. They are a publishing contract, not optional style advice.

- `content` is inserted inside Distribb's existing `.blog-content` element. Submit an HTML **fragment**, never a complete document.
- Never include `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, a page `<h1>`, document metadata/schema, page-level `<style>`, or executable `<script>`. Distribb owns the document shell, H1, metadata, schema, author block, sidebar, and CSS.
- Give every H2 a unique, stable, URL-safe `id`. When there are two or more H2s, include exactly one `<nav class="table-of-contents">` whose anchors resolve to the current IDs.
- Preserve existing wrappers, classes, IDs, `data-*` attributes, tables, links, and embeds during edits.
- Wrap every YouTube iframe in `<div class="youtube-embed">`; include a descriptive `title`, `loading="lazy"`, `allowfullscreen`, and no fixed dimensions.

For every edit: GET and save the article as a rollback copy; patch its fetched `Content`; diff and validate the fragment/IDs/TOC/embeds; PUT only changed fields; GET and verify readback. Published articles keep their slug and status: the API freezes the slug and rejects a move back to Draft/Planned. Distribb-hosted posts are live from the database; when a PUT returns `sync_required: true`, call `POST /api/v1/articles/:id/sync` (or resend the PUT with `"sync": true`; the CLI flag is `--sync`). Never republish or create a replacement for an existing live article.

Before publishing, and again on the live URL, inspect desktop and mobile widths. Confirm the sidebar/TOC matches the real headings and every video fills the article column at 16:9. A non-2xx response or failed readback is failure.

## Commands Reference

### List Projects

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects | jq .
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "ID": 42,
      "BusinessName": "Acme Corp",
      "WebsiteUrl": "https://acme.com",
      "BusinessDescription": "...",
      "Language": "English (US)",
      "Status": "Active",
      "BacklinkCredits": 10,
      "BecklinksNetworkParticipation": "Yes",
      "ArticlesPerDay": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Check the `BecklinksNetworkParticipation` field. If it is `"Yes"`, this project is part of the backlink exchange network. You MUST call `/backlink-targets` before writing each article and include 1-2 target URLs in the content. This is how the user earns backlinks from other real businesses. Skipping this means the user gives nothing and receives nothing from the network.

### Project Settings (Read & Edit): the FULL settings surface

`GET` returns a `settings` object; `PUT` accepts that **same shape**. So the loop is: GET, change the keys you want, PUT them back (read-modify-write). The PUT exposes the *entire* Settings UI, ~30 fields, not just a handful, so you can configure a project end-to-end without the dashboard. This is what makes agency-scale onboarding possible.

```bash
# Read current settings  (returns { "project": {...}, "settings": {...} })
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects/42 | jq .settings

# Edit settings (send ONLY the keys you want to change, partial updates are safe)
curl -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sitemap_url": "https://acme.com/sitemap.xml",
    "blog_root_url": "https://acme.com/blog",
    "content_pillars": ["https://acme.com/crm", "https://acme.com/pricing"],
    "internal_links_per_article": 3,
    "tone": "Conversational",
    "writing_profile": "Balanced SEO",
    "product_positioning": "Soft mention",
    "image_hosting": "CMS",
    "brand_color": "#1d4ed8",
    "cta_intensity": "Soft",
    "competitors": ["https://competitor1.com", "https://competitor2.com"],
    "brand_intelligence": true,
    "duplicate_content_protection": true,
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  }' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects/42 | jq .
```

**Writable fields** (every key the `settings` object returns is writable; aliases in parentheses):

| Field | Meaning / allowed values |
|-------|--------------------------|

| `competitors` (`competitor_websites`) | **List of competitor domains** (read AND write). |

**Partial updates are safe.** The article-quality and image preferences are stored as merged JSON, so sending just `{"cta_intensity": "Soft"}` changes ONLY that, the other quality flags keep their current values. Invalid enum values return `400` with a message naming the allowed values.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "project_id": 42,
  "updated_fields": ["tone", "cta_intensity", "competitors"],
  "updated_columns": ["ContentStyle", "ArticleQualitySettings", "CompetitorWebsites"],
  "message": "Project settings updated."
}
```

**Not settable via API:**
- `articles_per_day` is plan-controlled. If sent, it's echoed back under `ignored`. Read it via `GET /api/v1/projects` or the `settings` block.
- **Optimization thresholds** (`min_position`, `max_position`, `min_impressions_per_week`, `min_article_age_days`, `excluded_article_ids`) are applied at scan time by `POST /api/v1/suggestions/run`, not yet persisted per project. Sent values are echoed under `ignored`.

### Create a Project (agency-scale onboarding)

Spin up a brand-new project for a client and configure it in ONE call. You can pass any writable settings field from the table above alongside the basics.

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "website_url": "https://client.com",
    "business_name": "Client Co",
    "business_description": "Bookkeeping for trades businesses.",
    "target_audience": ["plumbers", "electricians"],
    "tone": "Conversational",
    "content_pillars": ["https://client.com/bookkeeping", "https://client.com/payroll"],
    "competitors": ["https://rival.com"]
  }' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects | jq .
```

**Response (201):** `{ "project_id": 77, "project_slots": {"used": 3, "total": 5}, "next_step": "...", ... }`

**Project slots are gated by the paid quantity.** If the account is already at its limit, you get **HTTP 402**:
```json
{
  "error": "project_limit_reached",
  "active_projects": 5,
  "project_quantity": 5,
  "purchase_url": "https://distribb.io/dashboard?add_project=1",
  "instructions_for_agent": "Tell the user they've hit their project limit and share purchase_url ..."
}
```
When you see this: **show the user `purchase_url`** (one click opens the "Buy More Seats" dialog in their dashboard). Once they confirm they bought a slot, **retry the same POST**. Never try to bypass the limit.

Creating a project **does NOT start keyword research** (that spends credits). After it's created, **ASK the user** whether they want to kick off keyword research + the first articles now. If yes, call the onboarding endpoint below.

### Run Onboarding (keyword research + first articles)

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects/77/onboarding | jq .
```

Starts the same pipeline the dashboard runs when onboarding finishes: GSC-aware keyword discovery -> a planned content calendar -> the first articles begin generating. Returns **202**; poll `GET /api/v1/articles?project_id=77` to watch planned articles appear.

- **Always ask the user first**, this spends keyword/LLM credits.
- If the project already has articles, it returns `already_onboarded` and does nothing.
- On Agentic plans and on legacy Free Agentic accounts this returns `skipped_byok` (those plans bring their own keywords, use `POST /api/v1/keywords/search` then `POST /api/v1/articles`).

### Connect WordPress

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "wordpress_url": "https://client.com", "integration_key": "<plugin Integration Key>" }' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/projects/77/wordpress | jq .
```

Install the Distribb WordPress plugin on the site, copy its **Integration Key**, and send it here. Credentials are validated (format check + live probe) before saving, the same checks the dashboard runs. Returns `{ "status": "connected" }`; if live validation is inconclusive (WAF/network) it still saves and returns a `warning`.

### Business Context

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/business-context?project_id=42" | jq .
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "business_name": "Acme Corp",
  "website_url": "https://acme.com",
  "description": "CRM platform for startups...",
  "competitors": ["https://competitor1.com", "https://competitor2.com"],
  "ai_instructions": "Use a friendly tone, focus on SaaS...",
  "language": "English (US)",
  "target_audience": "SaaS founders, startup CTOs",
  "internal_links_per_article": 5
}
```

Use this before writing. The `competitors` list tells you which domains to NEVER link to. The `ai_instructions` field has custom writing guidelines from the user.

### Keyword Research

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"keyword": "project management", "project_id": 42}' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/keywords/search | jq .
```

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "keywords": [
    {
      "keyword": "best project management tools",
      "search_volume": 12000,
      "keyword_difficulty": 35
    }
  ]
}
```

Returns the seed keyword plus up to 20 related keywords with volume and difficulty.

#### BYO Keys, legacy Free Agentic accounts

The free Agentic plan is deprecated and no longer offered to new users, but existing accounts still run. If the calling user is on one of those legacy **Free Agentic** accounts and has not yet saved a DataForSEO or Ahrefs API key, this endpoint returns **HTTP 402 Payment Required** with a structured body so your agent knows exactly what to do. Current plans (Agentic Mode at $49/month, Pro at $97/month, and Accelerator) never see this response.

**Response (402 Payment Required):**
```json
{
  "error": "byo_keys_required",
  "message": "Keyword research requires your own DataForSEO or Ahrefs API key.",
  "plan": "Agentic Free",
  "required": { "any_of": ["dataforseo", "ahrefs"] },
  "setup_url": "https://distribb.io/settings#seo-keys",
  "docs_url": "https://distribb.io/api-docs#byo-keys",
  "instructions_for_agent": "Tell the user to add their DataForSEO Login + API Key (or Ahrefs API Key) at distribb.io/settings, then re-run keyword research."
}
```

**Agent contract, what to do when you see this 402:**

1. **Halt** the keyword-research step. Do not retry automatically.
2. **Surface** the `instructions_for_agent` string verbatim to the human user.
3. **Link** the user to `setup_url` (Distribb Settings → SEO Data API Keys).
4. **Resume** keyword research only after the user confirms they've saved keys.

Pseudocode:

```python
resp = call_distribb("/api/v1/keywords/search", body)
if resp.status_code == 402 and resp.json().get("error") == "byo_keys_required":
    instructions = resp.json()["instructions_for_agent"]
    setup_url    = resp.json()["setup_url"]
    say_to_user(f"{instructions} Setup link: {setup_url}")
    return  # do not retry; wait for user
```

If the user has saved only an Ahrefs key (not DataForSEO), the response is sourced from Ahrefs Keywords Explorer and includes `"source": "byo_ahrefs"` plus a `note` field. All other endpoints in this skill (articles, integrations, backlinks, internal links) work normally on legacy Free Agentic accounts without any BYO keys.

### Internal Links

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/internal-links?project_id=42&keyword=crm+software" | jq .
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "links": [
    {
      "url": "https://acme.com/blog/crm-guide",
      "title": "The Complete CRM Guide",
      "keyword": "crm guide",
      "meta_description": "Everything you need..."
    }
  ],
  "num_links_recommended": 5,
  "website_url": "https://acme.com"
}
```

Include the recommended number of internal links in each article. Place them naturally in the middle of paragraphs using `<a href="EXACT_URL">descriptive anchor text</a>`. Never use "click here". Space links at least 2 paragraphs apart.

### Backlink Exchange

```bash
# Get backlink targets to include in your article
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/backlink-targets?project_id=42&keyword=crm+software" | jq .

# Check credits and status
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/backlinks/status?project_id=42" | jq .
```

**Targets response:**
```json
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "url": "https://partner-site.com/related-article",
      "title": "Related Partner Article",
      "meta_description": "...",
      "project_name": "Partner Co"
    }
  ],
  "category": "saas",
  "credits": 10,
  "instructions": "Include 1-2 of these URLs as natural references..."
}
```

**How the backlink exchange works:**
Distribb connects real businesses that exchange backlinks with each other. When you include a link to a network partner in your article, Distribb detects it on submission and credits the user's project. The more backlinks the user gives out, the more they receive in return. These are high-quality, high-DR backlinks from real business websites.

The `category` field shows how the keyword was classified (e.g. "saas", "ecommerce"). Targets are capped at 5 per request. Include 1-2 backlink targets per article as natural references. Do NOT fabricate information about linked sites. Use topically relevant anchor text.

### Backlink Ledger (full link-level detail)

`GET /backlinks/status` gives the aggregate (credits + counts). `GET /backlinks` gives the **link-by-link ledger** behind it: every earned (verified) link and every scheduled/upcoming link, with the source domain, source Domain Rating, source business name, the target URL on the user's own site, status, and date, plus a velocity + competitor-gap summary. Use it to answer "which sites actually link to me, and how strong are they?"

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/backlinks?project_id=42" | jq .
```

**Query parameters:** `project_id` (required), `earned_limit` (default 100, max 500), `scheduled_limit` (default 50, max 200).

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "project_id": 42,
  "earned": [
    {
      "id": 55123,
      "source_domain": "partner-site.com",
      "source_business": "Partner Co",
      "source_dr": 61,
      "source_url": "https://partner-site.com/related-article",
      "target_url": "https://acme.com/blog/crm-guide",
      "status": "Verified",
      "date": "2026-06-14"
    }
  ],
  "earned_count": 1,
  "scheduled": [
    {
      "id": 55130,
      "source_domain": "another-partner.com",
      "source_business": "Another Partner",
      "source_dr": 48,
      "target_url": "https://acme.com/blog/pricing",
      "status": "Scheduled",
      "scheduled_since": "2026-06-30"
    }
  ],
  "scheduled_count": 1,
  "velocity": {
    "velocity_cap": 8,
    "velocity_used": 3,
    "competitor_gap_percent": 42,
    "competitor_gap_target": 120
  },
  "note": "Per-link anchor text is not captured yet; anchor-mix distribution is not included."
}
```

Scheduled links usually have no `source_url` yet (the linking article is still being written), so only `source_domain`/`source_business`/`source_dr` are populated for them. **Per-link anchor text is not tracked yet**, so this endpoint intentionally does NOT return an anchor-text-mix breakdown. Do not infer or fabricate one.

### Generate Article (Pro plan only)

If the user wants Distribb to write the article from their source content (notes, drafts, talking points), use this endpoint. Distribb's AI will expand it into a full SEO article with YouTube videos, images, quotes, backlinks, and internal links. Costs 1 article credit. Not available on the Agentic plan.

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": 42,
    "keyword": "link building strategies",
    "source_content": "Link building is about getting other websites to link to yours. Three main approaches: guest posting, broken link building, and creating linkable assets like original research...",
    "instructions": "Add YouTube videos, include data and statistics",
    "article_style": "Informative"
  }' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/generate | jq .
```

**Response (202):**
```json
{
  "article_id": 456,
  "status": "generating",
  "keyword": "link building strategies",
  "slug": "link-building-strategies",
  "message": "Article generation started...",
  "article_credits_remaining": 29
}
```

The article takes a few minutes to generate. Poll `GET /api/v1/articles/456` to check when `Status` changes from `Planned` to `Draft` or `Published`.

### Create Article

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": 42,
    "keyword": "best crm tools for startups",
    "title": "10 Best CRM Tools for Startups in 2026",
    "content": "<nav class=\"table-of-contents\" aria-label=\"Table of contents\"><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a></li></ul></nav><h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2><p>Finding the right CRM...</p>",
    "meta_description": "Compare the 10 best CRM tools for startups.",
    "feature_image": "https://cdn.example.com/crm-comparison-hero.png",
    "alt_text": "Comparison chart of the 10 best CRM tools for startups",
    "scheduled_date": "2026-04-01T09:00:00Z",
    "status": "Planned"
  }' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles | jq .
```

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "article_id": 123,
  "status": "Planned",
  "keyword": "best crm tools for startups",
  "slug": "best-crm-tools-for-startups",
  "message": "Article created as Planned.",
  "backlinks_processed": 2
}
```

**If the article contained NO network backlinks, the response includes a warning:**
```json
{
  "article_id": 124,
  "status": "Draft",
  "keyword": "crm for freelancers",
  "slug": "crm-for-freelancers",
  "message": "Article created as Draft.",
  "backlinks_processed": 0,
  "backlinks_warning": "Your project participates in the backlinks network but this article contains no backlinks to other network members. Include backlink targets (from GET /api/v1/backlink-targets) to earn credits and keep receiving backlinks."
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** If `backlinks_warning` is present in the response:
1. Call `GET /backlink-targets` to fetch network URLs for the article's keyword.
2. Revise the article content to naturally include 1-2 of those URLs.
3. Call `PUT /api/v1/articles/{article_id}` with the revised content.
4. If the user has disabled automatic revision, inform them: "This article doesn't include any backlinks to the exchange network. You won't earn backlink credits for it, which means fewer backlinks from other businesses."

### Feature image

`feature_image` is an absolute `http(s)` URL, stored as the article's hero. Send
`alt_text` with it; if you omit it, the title is used. Both fields also work on
`PUT /api/v1/articles/{id}`, where `"feature_image": ""` clears the hero.

**Distribb cannot generate an image for you through this API.** The writer pipeline
that normally produces a hero does not run on content you submit yourself, so an
article you create here has no feature image unless you supply one. Generating a new
image is a dashboard action.

**IMPORTANT:** If `image_warning` is present in the response, the article has no hero:

1. If `image_candidates` is also present, those are absolute image URLs already
   embedded in the article body. Promote the best one:
   `PUT /api/v1/articles/{article_id}` with `{"feature_image": "<url>"}`.
2. **Do not blindly take the first candidate.** In a listicle the early images are
   usually screenshots of the competitors being reviewed, and a competitor's product
   shot makes a poor hero for the user's own article. Pick one that represents the
   user's brand, or a neutral/illustrative one.
3. If there are no candidates, ask the user for an image URL rather than leaving it
   blank silently.

Without a hero the article loses its `og:image` (no preview card when the link is
shared), its schema.org `image`, its on-page hero, and its thumbnail on the blog
index. Medium and LinkedIn syndication read the same field.

For long articles, write the HTML to a file and use `@` syntax:

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg content "$(cat article.html)" '{
    "project_id": 42,
    "keyword": "best crm tools",
    "title": "10 Best CRM Tools",
    "content": $content,
    "status": "Draft"
  }')" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles | jq .
```

Setting a `scheduled_date` schedules the article: submit it as a `Draft` with a date and Distribb auto-promotes it to `Planned` (passing `status: Planned` yourself is still fine). Omit the date and it stays a `Draft` for review. What happens ON the date depends on the project's `PublishingStatus` (read it from `GET /api/v1/projects`): `Publish Immediately` goes live; `Save as Drafts` keeps it as a draft inside Distribb for manual review; `Send as Drafts` pushes it to the CMS as a draft. So a correctly-scheduled article on a `Save as Drafts` project will NOT auto-publish to the live site, that is by design, not a bug.

### Update Article

Use this to revise an article after submission, including a Published article. Follow the mandatory fetch-patch-verify protocol above: GET and preserve the current article, patch its fetched `Content`, and send only changed fields.

```bash
curl -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg content "$(cat revised-article.html)" '{
    "content": $content
  }')" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/123 | jq .
```

**Updatable fields:** `title`, `content`, `meta_description`, `keyword`, `article_style`, `status` (Draft or Planned), `scheduled_date`, `category`, `published_at`, `sync`. Send only the fields you want to change. On a Published article the slug is frozen (changing `keyword` updates the keyword but no longer moves the URL) and `status` cannot go back to Draft/Planned, so the live URL and publication state cannot drift.

- `category`: the CMS category NAME to assign (e.g. `"Accessibility Guides"`). It must ALREADY exist on the destination CMS (WordPress or GoHighLevel); Distribb resolves the name to that platform's category at publish time and cannot create new categories. Send `""` to clear it. Detection ships for WordPress and GoHighLevel; other CMSs ignore it for now.
- `published_at`: a PAST ISO 8601 timestamp used to BACKDATE the post on the CMS (e.g. `"2024-02-05T09:00:00Z"`). This changes only the date the CMS records, NOT when Distribb publishes and NOT the article's position on the content calendar (that is `scheduled_date`). Send `""`/`null` to clear it. Backdating is applied on GoHighLevel today.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "article_id": 123,
  "updated_fields": ["Content", "IsPreGenerated"],
  "message": "Article updated successfully.",
  "backlinks_processed": 2,
  "sync_required": false
}
```

If content is updated and the project participates in the backlink network, Distribb re-scans for network backlinks and updates credits. GET and validate readback after the PUT. If the response says `sync_required: true`, call `POST /api/v1/articles/:id/sync`; this overwrites the existing CMS post and never creates a replacement. Distribb-hosted posts return `sync_required: false` and are live immediately.

### Update a Published Article (edit content that is already live)

Published articles ARE editable. The edit lands inside Distribb first; the live post on the site changes only when you **sync** it. That two-step split means a typo can never go live by accident.

```bash
# 1. Edit the stored article
curl -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg content "$(cat corrected-article.html)" '{"content": $content}')" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/123 | jq .

# 2. Push it to the live post (updates in place, never creates a duplicate)
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/123/sync | jq .
```

**`sync_required` tells you whether a push is even needed.** Every PUT response carries it:

- `false` on an unpublished article (nothing is live yet).
- `false` on a Distribb-hosted post (distribb.io serves `/blog/<slug>` straight from the database, so the edit is live the moment it saves).
- `true` when a live post exists on an external CMS. That is the only case that needs a sync.

Or do both in one call with `"sync": true`:

```bash
curl -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "The Corrected Title", "sync": true}' \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/123 | jq .
```

**Two fields are frozen once an article is live:**

- `keyword` still updates the main keyword, but it no longer regenerates the slug. The slug IS the public URL and the key Distribb matches the remote post on, so changing it would 404 the live page and make the next sync create a second post.
- `status` cannot go back to `Draft` or `Planned` (returns `400 cannot_unpublish`). That would orphan the live post and let the scheduler publish a duplicate over the top of it. To take a post down, unpublish it from the Distribb dashboard or delete it in the CMS.

**Sync outcomes:**

| Response | What it means |
|---|---|
| `200 {"status":"synced","url":...}` | The live post now carries your edit. |
| `400 {"error":"not_published"}` | Nothing live to update yet. Use `POST /api/v1/articles/<id>/publish` first. |
| `400 {"error":"no_cms_integration"}` | The site is disconnected. Reconnect it at https://distribb.io/integrations . |
| `400 {"error":"unsupported_for_sync"}` | That platform has no update path yet. Edit the post directly on the platform. |
| `400 {"error":"sync_failed"}` | The CMS rejected the update; `message` carries the platform's reason. The Distribb-side edit is still saved, so fix the cause and retry the sync. |

**In-place updates are supported on:** WordPress, API Webhook, Shopify, Webflow, Wix, Ghost, GoHighLevel, Framer, Notion. Anything else returns `unsupported_for_sync`.

Syncing is safe to repeat. Distribb finds the remote post by its stored ID, then slug, then title, and fails closed rather than risk publishing a duplicate.

**CLI:**

```bash
python distribb_cli.py articles:update --article-id 123 --content-file corrected.html --sync
python distribb_cli.py articles:sync --article-id 123
```

### Delete Article

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/123 | jq .
```

Deletes a `Draft` or `Planned` article. **Published articles cannot be deleted** (the live CMS post would be orphaned), you get a `400`. Unpublish or hide it from the dashboard/CMS first, or simply unschedule it.

**Response (200):**
```json
{ "article_id": 123, "deleted": true, "message": "Article deleted." }
```

To take an article off the calendar *without* deleting it, **unschedule** instead: `PUT /api/v1/articles/123` with body `{"scheduled_date": null}`.

### List Articles

```bash
# All articles for a project (default: 50 per page)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles?project_id=42" | jq .

# Filter by status
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles?project_id=42&status=Published" | jq .

# Pagination: use limit (max 200) and offset
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  "https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles?project_id=42&limit=20&offset=40" | jq .
```

**Query parameters:** `project_id` (optional), `status` (optional: Draft, Planned, Published), `limit` (default 50, max 200), `offset` (default 0).

### Get Single Article

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/123 | jq .
```

### Publish Article

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  https://distribb.io/api/v1/articles/123/publish | jq .
```

Pushes the article to the user's connected CMS (WordPress, Webflow, Shopify, etc.). A manual publish like this **always goes live**, even if the project is set to `Save as Drafts` / `Send as Drafts`, that preference only controls AUTOMATIC scheduled publishing, not a deliberate "publish now". Returns `200` with `{"status":"published","url":...}` once the CMS confirms a live URL; `202` with `{"status":"pending"}` if the CMS hasn't confirmed yet (it will retry, the article is NOT lost).

Use this only for Draft/Planned articles without a live post. For a Published article, PUT and then use the update-only `/sync` endpoint when requested; never publish it again.

**The project must have a website/CMS connected.** If none is, this returns **`400` with `{"error":"no_cms_integration"}`** and a `connect_url`. Surface that to the user verbatim, there is nowhere to publish until they connect their site at https://distribb.io/integrations . This is the single most common reason a scheduled article never publishes: a Google Search Console (analytics) connection is NOT a publishing destination. Before you tell a user an article will publish, confirm a CMS is connected with `GET /api/v1/integrations`.

### Social Media Repurposing (Automatic)

When an article is published to the user's CMS, Distribb automatically generates social media posts for every platform the user has connected (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, etc.). The agent does not need to call any endpoint for this. It happens server-side.

The social posts are created as drafts in the user's content calendar so they can review, edit, or schedule them from the Distribb dashboard. If the user has connected social accounts, publishing an article through the API triggers this automatically.

### Posting to Social Media Yourself

Repurposing is automatic, but you can also write a post and send it to the user's connected accounts. This is the same publisher behind the dashboard's Social Composer, so anything you send lands in their calendar next to everything else.

**1. See what is connected.**

```bash
curl -s "https://distribb.io/api/v1/social/accounts?project_id=42" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" | jq
```

Returns `{connected, accounts: [{platform, account_id, account_name}], instructions_for_agent}`. A project with nothing connected is not an error: it returns `200` with `connected: false`. Connecting an account is a browser OAuth step at https://distribb.io/integrations, so you cannot do it for the user.

**2. Post.**

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://distribb.io/api/v1/social/publish \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISTRIBB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": 42,
    "content": "The three keyword mistakes that cost us six months.",
    "platforms": ["linkedin", "x"],
    "link": "https://example.com/blog/keyword-mistakes"
  }' | jq
```

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `project_id` | Required. Must be a project the API key's account owns or is a team member of. |
| `content` | Required. The post text. |
| `platforms` | Required. `["linkedin", "x"]`, or `[{"platform": "x", "account_id": "..."}]` when one platform has several connected accounts. |
| `link` | Optional. Stored with the post. On LinkedIn and Facebook it is appended to the text so the preview card renders. |
| `media_files` | Optional. `[{"type": "image", "s3_url": "..."}]`. |
| `platform_overrides` | Optional. Per-platform copy and per-network options, keyed by platform. |
| `scheduled_for` | Optional ISO8601 UTC. Schedules the post instead of sending it now. |

The CLI wraps both:

```bash
python distribb_cli.py social:accounts --project-id 42
python distribb_cli.py social:publish --project-id 42 --platforms linkedin,x \
  --content "The three keyword mistakes that cost us six months." \
  --link https://example.com/blog/keyword-mistakes
```

Supported platforms: `x` (or `twitter`), `linkedin`, `facebook`, `instagram`, `threads`, `bluesky`, `reddit`, `tiktok`, `youtube`, `pinterest`, `telegram`, `snapchat`, `googlebusiness`.

**Per-platform copy beats one shared post.** Use `platform_overrides` to rewrite for each network and to reach the options only that network has:

```json
{
  "platform_overrides": {
    "x": {"threadSteps": ["Second tweet.", "Third tweet."]},
    "linkedin": {"text": "A longer, first-person version.", "firstComment": "Full breakdown: https://example.com/blog/keyword-mistakes"},
    "reddit": {"subredditName": "SEO", "title": "What six months of keyword mistakes taught us"}
  }
}
```

**Scheduling.** With `scheduled_for` the post is saved as scheduled and goes out within five minutes of that time, and the user can still edit or delete it in the dashboard until then. The response is a `201` with `scheduled: true`. Without it the post publishes immediately and the response carries the live URLs.

**Character limits are enforced server-side**: X 280, Bluesky 300, Threads 500, Pinterest 500, Google Business 1500, Instagram and TikTok 2200, LinkedIn 3000, YouTube 5000. Going over is a `400` naming the platform and the count, so write to the limit rather than fixing it after a rejection.

**Confirm the copy before you send it.** A published post is public and immediate, and deleting it later does not undo who saw it. Show the user the exact text per platform and wait for a yes, unless they have already told you to post without checking.

### YouTube SEO With Motion Videos (`/youtube-motion-video`)

Turn a keyword or concept into a short, faceless **motion-collage explainer video**
(bold screen-print cutout collage visuals, a calm "In a Nutshell" documentary voice),
optimize it for **YouTube SEO** with Distribb's real keyword + Search Console data, and
publish it to the user's connected **YouTube** channel through Distribb, then clos
