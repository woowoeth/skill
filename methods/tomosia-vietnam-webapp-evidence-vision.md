description: Look at what a recording actually shows, by tiling its frames into timestamped contact sheets you can read as images. Use when you need to know what happened in a video rather than take someone's word for it — checking a take you just recorded, finding where a layout breaks, locating the moment an error appeared, or answering a question about a video you cannot watch.

# vision

A video is not readable. You can read a picture, so this turns the video into pictures: one frame
every couple of seconds, each stamped with the time it came from, tiled into sheets.

```bash
node scripts/contact-sheet.js <video.mp4> --out <directory>
```

It prints one line per sheet with the span that sheet covers, then you read the sheets as images.

## Which video

Work down this list and stop at the first one that answers it:

1. **A path or a name in what the user just said.** Take it as given, even if another video is
   closer to hand.
2. **A recording made in this session.** You know where it went, so use it — this is the common
   case, someone recording a take and then asking what it shows.
3. **A directory the user named**, or the evidence directory this session has been working in: use
   the mp4 in it. More than one, and you are back to asking.
4. **Otherwise ask.** Name the candidates you can see if there are any.

Do not go looking around the disk for the newest mp4. The one that was modified last is not
reliably the one being asked about, and reading back the wrong recording produces findings that
sound authoritative and describe something else entirely.

## Why sheets and not the screenshots

A recording usually comes with screenshots already, and they are not the same thing. Screenshots are
taken where a step script decided to capture — so they show what somebody already knew to look for.
A sheet samples the whole take at an even cadence, which is where the unplanned things are: a layout
that breaks halfway through a transition, a banner that appears and disappears, a screen that never
finished loading.

If the question is "did the thing we meant to prove happen", the screenshots answer it faster. If
the question is "what actually happened", read a sheet.

## Reading one

Every tile carries `mm:ss` in its corner, the same shape the runbook's timeline uses. That is what
makes a finding usable: **name the time**, not the tile. "The header overlaps the table at 00:14" can
be checked in the mp4 and matched to a runbook line. "It looks broken in the third picture" cannot.

Scan for the things a still frame shows well: text overflowing its container, elements overlapping,
a layout that clearly does not fit the viewport, a blank or half-rendered screen, an error message.
Then say where, in time.

## When the defaults do not fit

One frame every 2s, four across and five down, 480px a tile — 20 tiles a sheet.

| The take | Try |
|---|---|
| Short, or something happens fast | `--every 1` |
| Long, and you want fewer sheets | `--every 4` or `--every 5` |
| Detail is too small to judge | `--tile 640 --columns 3` |
| You only need the shape of it | `--columns 6 --rows 4 --tile 320` |

`--help` lists them all, and is the way to find out what the script takes — reading
`contact-sheet.js` costs context and says nothing more. Sampling more often makes more sheets, not
bigger ones.

## What it needs

`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`. If either is missing, say so and offer to install it — do not paste install
instructions, and do not install anything until the user agrees.

Timestamps need a font ffmpeg can load. It looks for the usual ones on macOS and Linux; if none is
found the sheets are still produced without stamps, and the tool prints the arithmetic for working
out a tile's time from its position. Say that in your report rather than guessing at times.

## Closing the report

If reading the sheets was harder than it should have been — tiles too small to judge, a stamp that
was not there, a sampling interval that missed the thing — mention once that it can be reported with
`/webapp-evidence:feedback`. Only when there is something to say; a suggestion that appears on every
run is one nobody reads.
