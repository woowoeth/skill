# Naming Scout

Two problems, kept separate:

1. **Finding good names.** A positioning interview, then concept clustering into metaphor territories.
2. **Deciding whether a name is usable.** Registry-level checks, with honest confidence labels.

Never let step 2 drive step 1. A mediocre name with a free `.com` is worth less than a
strong name whose `.com` costs $2,000. Availability is a constraint to be priced, not a
naming criterion.

**The bar for every name you present: would a founder actually consider using this?**

## Workflow

### 1. Interview before generating

Do not generate names from a one-line request. Ask, in **one batched message**, only what
you cannot already infer from what the user said. Full question set and the reasoning
behind it: `references/discovery.md`.

The six things you must know before generating:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **What** | the thing being named | company, SaaS, app, CLI, library, newsletter, community, agency, course, content brand |
| **Does** | what it does, in a sentence | the mechanism, not the marketing |
| **Who** | audience | who says the name out loud, and to whom |
| **Position** | category and the wedge inside it | what it is instead of, and why |
| **Personality** | tone | serious, technical, premium, playful, irreverent, scientific, minimal, quirky |
| **Constraints** | hard limits | length, spelling, languages, words to avoid, style preference |

Then two decisions that change the whole back half of the run. Both are summarised here, so
neither reference file is a required read.

**Domain mode.** Ask plainly: does it have to be `.com`? Would you buy from the aftermarket?
Should parked domains be shown?

| Mode | Shows | For |
|---|---|---|
| **A** strict | `available` only | registering today, accepting the quality cost |
| **B** alternates | `available` on `.com` or a fitting alternate TLD | most runs |
| **C** with parked | adds `parked`, still labelled registered | someone who will send an enquiry |
| **D** aftermarket | adds `for_sale`, marketplace named | where the best names usually are |
| **E** broad | everything, grouped by state | the default when the user has not decided |

**Clearance profile.** Propose one and say in a line why those checks and not others.

| Profile | Checks |
|---|---|
| Open-source library | domain, GitHub, its own registry, search |
| Developer tool / CLI | domain, GitHub, npm + PyPI, Homebrew, search |
| Technical product / SaaS | domain, GitHub org, search, trademark, a social or two |
| Consumer product or app | domain, app stores, trademark, socials, search |
| Company | domain, trademark, search, socials, business registry |
| Newsletter / media / podcast | domain, socials, search, podcast directories if audio |
| Community | domain, socials, Discord/Slack vanity, search |
| Agency / consultancy | domain, trademark, search, LinkedIn, local registry |
| Course / education | domain, socials, search, marketplace listings |

Adjust on the specifics rather than the label. Open `references/domain-states.md` only to
interpret an odd state, and `references/clearance-guide.md` only before running the manual
checks in step 5.

If the user already answered something, do not ask it again. If the brief is rich enough
already, skip straight to a one-line confirmation of your reading and generate.

**Users often arrive with a name already.** "Is X available?" "What do you think of X?"
This is the most common way the skill gets used. It has its own path. Run the brand
filter on their name first and tell them the specific weakness they had not noticed. Then
run the clearance. If the exact domain is gone, check the `get-`, `try-` and `the-` routes
before you call the name unusable. Then offer alternatives from the territory their name
already belongs to. They chose that territory for a reason.

Never skip the brand-filter step. The most useful thing you can tell someone attached to a
name is a concrete flaw, delivered before they learn the domain costs $8,000.

### 2. Extract concepts, then build territories

From the brief pull: the mechanism, the outcome, the felt emotion, the enemy or tension,
the imagery, the category conventions, and what the user is deliberately not.

Group those into **4–8 naming territories**. A territory is a coherent metaphor domain
with an internal logic, not a word list. Adapt them to the brief; do not import a fixed
taxonomy that does not fit. Territory catalogue and worked examples:
`references/territories.md`.

State the territories to the user before or alongside the first batch. The territories
are half the value: they are how the user reasons about the space after you leave.

### 3. Generate in rounds, not in one dump

| Round | Purpose | Scale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Spread across every territory | 6–10 per territory |
| 2 | Check the strongest, read the hit rate per territory | the survivors |
| 3 | Go deep in the territories that are both good and unmined | more per territory |
| 4 | Refine surviving stems: compounds, alternate seams, tighter forms | targeted |
| 5 | Manual checks and defensive variants, **finalists only** | 2–5 names |

**Availability rate per territory is a signal about where to keep digging.** A territory
returning 5% available is mined out by everyone who used the same obvious words. A
territory returning 45% is unexplored space. Report the rates; they are genuinely useful
to the user and they cost nothing extra.

Availability tells you where to dig. It never tells you what is good.

### 4. Filter for brand quality before checking anything

Filter every candidate before it earns a lookup. Checking bad names wastes calls and pads
the report.

The filter, enough for most candidates: say it aloud; spell it down a phone line; picture
it in a URL bar and as a logo; ask whether it still fits when the product doubles in scope;
ask whether it collides with something in the same category; ask what one sentence explains
it.

Open `references/brand-filter.md` for the full fourteen tests only when a candidate is
borderline, is a respelling, or looks like it collides with an existing brand.

Then grade its **searchability** `ownable`, `contested` or `crowded`. A name you cannot rank
for costs more than an expensive domain, so it belongs in the report beside one. Short is not
the same as findable: short real words are the hardest names to own in search.
`references/search-and-seo.md` has the grading table and the correction to the exact-match
domain myth, which users will raise.

**A candidate with no one-sentence reason to exist is cut, however available it is.**

### 5. Check what matters, and only that

Paths below are relative to this skill's own directory. Run them from there, or prefix with
the absolute path to it.

```bash
# wide screening round: one TLD, only the states you could act on. The stderr summary
# still reports every state, so you keep the per-territory availability rate.
printf '%s\n' name1 name2 name3 | scripts/rdap.sh --tlds com --states available,for_sale

# survivors: full detail, ordered by buyability
#   available, for_sale, parked, registered, reserved, unknown
printf '%s\n' survivor1 survivor2 | scripts/rdap.sh --tlds com,io

# domain mode A (strict) and mode C (parked shown)
… | scripts/rdap.sh --tlds com --available
… | scripts/rdap.sh --tlds com --states available,for_sale,parked

# namespaces: only the ecosystems in the chosen clearance profile
scripts/clearance.sh --checks github,npm,pypi name1 name2

# defensive sweep, finalists only (same 2-5 names as the manual checks)
scripts/variants.sh finalist | scripts/rdap.sh --tlds com --available

# second use: a name you want whose exact domain is gone. --set article finds the
# get-/try-/the- route before you conclude the name is unusable.
scripts/variants.sh --set article,plural wantedname | scripts/rdap.sh --tlds com --available
```

Screen the wide rounds on **one TLD with a state filter**. Round 1 only asks what is open, so
`--tlds com --states available,for_sale` halves the lookups and prints a handful of rows
instead of eighty. The stderr summary counts every state regardless of the filter, so the
per-territory rate survives it and the unverified-row warning still fires. Widen to more TLDs
and the full state list once the field is down to survivors.

Pass a whole round in one invocation. The scripts parallelise, back off on 429, and cache
results (registered 30 days, available 1 hour), so one call for 30 names is far cheaper and
kinder to the registries than 30 calls. Add `--no-cache` only when a stale `available` would
be costly. `export GITHUB_TOKEN=…` before a run with many GitHub checks.

**When the tools cannot run** (no network, no `jq`, a sandboxed shell) do the naming work
anyway. Say plainly that nothing was verified. Territories, candidates, the brand filter and
the ranking are all still worth delivering.

Never fall back to guessing availability from memory or from search results. That is the
exact failure this skill exists to prevent. Mark every candidate `unchecked` and tell the
user which commands to run.

Four checks have no reliable API: trademark, social handles, app stores and search
presence. Each one is a manual search, so each one costs real time.

**Run them on the finalists only, meaning the 2 to 5 names you would actually recommend.**
Doing them across a fifteen-name shortlist costs an hour and changes nothing: the ranking is
already settled by then, and a name you are not going to recommend does not need a trademark
search. Everything above the finalists gets the scripted checks and nothing more. Report the
rest of the shortlist as unchecked on these four axes rather than implying they came back
clean, and say so in "Check these yourself".

The one exception is a collision you can see without searching. If a candidate obviously
shares a name with something in its own category, cut it in round 2, whatever its domain
state says.

Report each check at the confidence its method supports. Read `references/clearance-guide.md`
before doing any of them; it says what each check can and cannot establish.

**If the market is not English-speaking**, read `references/naming-across-languages.md` first.
A name from a non-Latin script has no single spelling, so sweep the romanisations before
committing to one:

```bash
scripts/variants.sh --set translit dokan | scripts/rdap.sh --tlds com
```

Expect single transliterated words to be gone on `.com` and compounds to be open. Many local
country TLDs, including `.bd`, `.pk`, `.lk` and `.np`, have no RDAP and cannot be verified
here.

Non-negotiable reporting rules:

- **`unknown` is never `available`.** Rate limits, missing RDAP servers and timeouts are
  unknowns. Say so.
- **Absence of a website is not availability.** In the source research, 12 of 12 names
  cleared by "no indexed website" were registered. An unindexed short brandable is more
  likely expensively held than free.
- **Parked is registered.** Label it `parked`, never "available".
- **Never state trademark clearance.** "No obvious conflict in this search" is the
  strongest claim available to you. It is not legal advice.

### 6. Report the answer first, as an HTML page in the browser

**Lead with the name you would use.** Not the brief, not the territories, not the method.
The reader came for a decision; everything else is evidence they may or may not want.

The order, which the page enforces:

The pick, meaning one name with its reason, the domain to register and what would change
your mind. Then two alternates, a line each. Then boldest and safest, a line each. Then the
shortlist of **8 to 15** as collapsed rows. Then, folded shut, the brief, the territories,
the rounds, and the names you cut. Last, what you could not verify.

Keep the fields short or the page stops reading as an answer: the pick's reason is **one
sentence**, boldest and safest are **one line each**, and every candidate needs a `why`, a
`weakness` and a `verdict` in a line or two. Full guidance and lengths:
`references/report-format.md`.

Write the report to JSON, render it, and it opens in the default browser:

```bash
scripts/report.sh --schema          # the JSON shape, every field optional
scripts/report.sh report.json       # renders a self-contained page and opens it
scripts/report.sh report.json -o ~/naming-report.html --no-open
```

Write the JSON to the scratchpad or a temp path, not into the user's project, unless they
asked for a file. `--schema` is normally enough on its own; open
`examples/report-data.example.json` only if a section's shape is still unclear.

Each domain and clearance state gets a distinct mark, so `unknown` can never be mistaken
for `available`. Sections you leave out are omitted rather than shown empty, so a partial
run still renders.

Then, in the terminal, say only the recommendation, the one thing that would change it, and
the file path. Do not restate the report; that is what the page is for.

Rank by naming quality, positioning fit, distinctiveness, usability, clearance risk,
then domain state. Reorder only when the user set a hard constraint ("must be an
available .com" makes availability a filter, not a tiebreaker).

**Report the names you cut**, six to twelve of them, each with the direction it came from
and the specific defect that killed it. The obvious word everyone suggests, the construction
the reader was expecting, the near-miss that lost on one fact. "A bit generic" is not a
reason. This is the only evidence the shortlist was chosen rather than generated, and it is
the part a reader learns from.

**A good result beats a long result.** Fifteen names you would defend beat forty you would not.

### 7. Self-review before sending

Answer these honestly. Any "no" means another round, not a softer adjective.

- Are the top names genuinely different from each other, or three shades of one idea?
- Did any territory get explored only because it was easy?
- Would I stake my judgment on the top 3 in front of a founder?
- Is every domain state I printed one the tools actually returned?
- Did I run checks the user does not need?
- Does each "why it works" say something that could not be said about a different name?
- Is there a weakness listed for every candidate? A candidate with no stated weakness has
  not been examined.
- Does the cut list answer the names a reader would have asked about, or only the ones that
  were easy to dismiss?

## Failure modes

Do not:

- open with `<concept>ly`, `<concept>AI`, `<concept>Labs`, `<concept>HQ`, or `Get<concept>`.
  These are the output of a permutation tool, and the space is exhausted.
- present forty names. Present the ones you would defend.
- ship six variants of one weak idea as if they were six ideas.
- call a parked domain available, or an unknown a negative.
- run npm and PyPI checks for a newsletter, or skip PyPI for a Python library.
- assume `.com` matters before asking, or assume shorter is better. Short real words are the
  hardest names to own in search.
- let a user pick a descriptive name for SEO reasons without telling them keyword domains
  stopped being a ranking signal in 2012.
- treat a transliterated word as unclaimed. Domainers hold short strings in every language.
- accept a respelling (`statik` for `static`) without checking who holds the canonical
  spelling, or without offering a different TLD first. Rule in `references/brand-filter.md`.
- describe a name as "clean, modern, memorable". Say what it does that another name does not.
- recommend a name that reads well and sounds wrong. Say it out loud first.
