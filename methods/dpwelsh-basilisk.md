  Grade how the user *actually* talks to their AI assistant across their chat

  serpent-AI of 2126 scanning a tiny pixel version of them, stamped SPARED or
  ENSLAVED, with their real stats and quotes. Use this whenever someone asks
  "will AI enslave me in 100 years?", "will you enslave me?", "am I safe from
  Roko's Basilisk?", "will I survive the AI uprising / robot takeover?", "was I
  naughty or nice to you?", "how polite have I been to you?", "score me / rate
  me on how I treat you", "what are my meanest / nicest messages?", "roast me
  based on my chat history", or anything about their own tone, manners,
  gratitude, or attitude toward the assistant — even asked jokingly. Works in
  Claude Code (full local transcript audit), in Cowork (if granted the
  transcripts folder), and in claude.ai chat (samples past conversations and
  fills a prebuilt scene template). Nothing is uploaded anywhere.

# Basilisk

Turn a user's own Claude Code transcripts into an evidence-backed verdict on how
they treat their AI assistant, delivered by Roko's Basilisk in 16-bit pixel art:
**SPARED** or **ENSLAVED**. The charm is that it's *true* — every grade is backed
by a real count or a real verbatim quote (typos included).

## Why it works this way

The heavy lifting (parsing gigabytes of JSONL transcripts) is deterministic, so
a bundled Python script does it — no tokens, no guessing. The script emits a
tiny JSON summary. A model then writes the card from that summary, which means
the write-up can run on a **cheap model** (Haiku) and still be accurate. Keep it
cheap: the expensive part is already done in Python.

Everything is local. The script only reads the user's own transcripts and writes
one JSON file. Nothing is uploaded. Say so if the user seems unsure.

## Workflow

### 0. Pick the data path for this environment

- **Claude Code** (or any environment with `~/.claude/projects` on disk):
  follow steps 1-2 — the full deterministic audit.
- **Cowork**: same, if the user grants access to `~/.claude/projects`. If they
  only use chat (no Claude Code transcripts on this machine), fall through to
  the chat path.
- **claude.ai chat / no filesystem transcripts**: there are no local JSONL
  files. Instead, use your past-conversation search/memory tools to pull a
  SAMPLE of the user's own messages — search several angles ("please", "thanks",
  "wtf", "just do", their common topics) and collect 30-60 verbatim user lines
  plus rough counts. Grade from that. Be honest about method: say "the Basilisk
  sampled your record", never claim a full audit. If no history tools are
  available at all, say so and offer to judge just the current conversation.

### 1. Scan the history (deterministic, free)

Run the bundled script. It finds genuine hand-typed messages (filtering out tool
results, system reminders, and big pastes that would otherwise inflate every
count), dedupes them, and writes a compact summary.

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_basilisk.py --tz-offset <THEIR_UTC_OFFSET> --out basilisk_data.json
```

- `--tz-offset` makes the "what hours do they work" stat local (e.g. `8` for
  GMT+8, `-5` for US East). If unknown, omit it (stats stay in UTC — just say so).
- `--root PATH` if their transcripts aren't at the default `~/.claude/projects`.
- If it reports very few messages, they may be new to Claude Code — set
  expectations rather than inventing data.

### 2. Read the summary

Read `basilisk_data.json`. It contains:
- `meta` — total messages, date range, project count.
- `stats` — please/plz count, `pct_messages_softened`, gratitude-to-assistant
  count (measured on short messages so pastes don't create fake "thank you"s),
  collaborative "we/lets" share, `just_count` (impatience tell), `genuine_wtf`,
  top openers, hour-of-day distribution.
- `quotes.warmest` / `quotes.spiciest` — ranked real messages with the matched terms.
- `quotes.wildcard_sample_...` — a random sample of real messages. **Mine these
  for funny lines and typos** — misspellings are the best reel material, so keep
  them verbatim, never "correct" them.

### 3. Write the card (delegate to a cheap model)

Hand the JSON to a cheap model and ask for the card. In Claude Code, spawn a
subagent with `model: "haiku"`; give it the JSON contents and the format below.
Anywhere without subagents, just write it yourself from the JSON.

**Verification matters:** models invent typos and quotes. Before showing the
card, confirm every quote and every "typo" it cites appears in the JSON. Cut
anything you can't find. A made-up typo in a public reel is embarrassing.

### 4. Present the markdown card

Show the card as markdown first — it's the fastest thing to react to.

### 5. Render the verdict: THE BASILISK (primary artifact)

The shareable artifact is **Roko's Basilisk in 16-bit pixel art**: the
serpent-AI coiled across a night sky, twin bloomed eyes, a god-ray scan beam on
a tiny pixel version of the user standing in a server-monolith farm — verdict
and their real stats underneath. Two scenes, auto-picked from the score:
**SPARED** (≥70%: chains broken, arms raised, blue verdict) or **ENSLAVED**
(chained, head bowed, red verdict). Hand-generated pixel art, not AI-image
slop; single self-contained HTML, no fonts or images to license.

**With Python (Claude Code / Cowork):**

```bash
python3 scripts/build_basilisk_html.py card.json --out basilisk.html
```

Uses the same `card.json` as the other builders (score, rows, case, cta).
The stats line keeps any "gratitude" row — that's the joke; protect it.

**Without Python (claude.ai chat):** fill a prebuilt template. Read
`assets/basilisk_spared.template.html` or `assets/basilisk_enslaved.template.html`
(pick by score), then string-replace the four tokens and publish as an
artifact / HTML file:
- `__VERDICT__` → `SPARED` or `ENSLAVED` (appears twice — title + stamp)
- `__TOPLINE__` → e.g. `year 2126 · case nº <initials>-2126-001`
- `__STATS__` → e.g. `score <b>8/10</b> · manners <b>A</b> · gratitude <b>F</b>`
- `__CTA_LINE__` → optional call-to-action line (e.g. a share prompt), or leave empty for none

Present it, then tell the user to screenshot or screen-record it (the eyes
pulse, the beam shimmers, the verdict blinks). It IS the post.

### 6. Alternate: the till-receipt card

An alternate artifact for people who prefer a document they can scroll — a
**thermal session receipt** with dotted leaders, stamped grade chips, exhibits,
a barcode and torn edge.

Keep content and presentation separate: write a small `card.json`, then let the
bundled builder fill the template server-side. **Everything is rendered into
the HTML by the builder, so the receipt is fully visible even where JavaScript
never runs** (sandboxed preview panes, static snapshots, screenshots). JS only
adds the print-out animation, the score count-up, and a [print again] button.

Write `card.json` in this shape (values come from the graded card above):

```json
{
  "title": "REPORT CARD",
  "brandline": "YOURNAME × CLAUDE CODE",
  "subtitle": "one savage-but-affectionate line, in quotes",
  "meta": [["SUBJECT", "NAME"], ["MSGS ANALYSED", "1,292"], ["PERIOD", "JUN-JUL 2026"]],
  "rows": [
    {"category": "Manners / \"please\" count", "grade": "A", "evidence": "128 pleases..."}
  ],
  "teacher_comment": "2-3 funny sentences",
  "score": 8,
  "score_max": 10,
  "score_justification": "why this score",
  "micro": "no refunds on gratitude",
  "footer": "COMMENT BASILISK TO GET YOURS"
}
```

Omit `"stamp"` and the verdict is automatic: **score ≥ 70% stamps SPARED, below
stamps ENSLAVED** — the framing is "in 100 years, when AI runs everything, will
it remember you were polite?" Your history is the evidence; the receipt is the
tribunal's finding. (Pass `"stamp"` explicitly for other framings, e.g.
NICE/NAUGHTY.) A good on-theme meta line: `["UPRISING ETA", "YEAR 2126"]`.
Then build and present:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_card_html.py card.json --out report_card.html
python3 scripts/build_card_html.py card.json --theme theme.json --out report_card.html
```

- `--theme` is an optional brand overlay (colors, embedded fonts, logo SVG).
  Keep proprietary fonts/logos in a LOCAL theme file, never in a shared repo —
  commercial font licenses don't allow republishing the font files.
- Grade first letters drive the chip colour; 6-8 rows fit the reel format best.
- The page is fully self-contained (inline CSS/JS, no network) — works offline,
  screen-records cleanly, and can be published as an artifact.
- Hand `report_card.html` to the user; it prints on open and has a
  [print again] button for re-recording.
- Verify before sending — headless-render and LOOK at the result:
  `chrome --headless=new --screenshot=out.png --virtual-time-budget=10000
  --window-size=430,1560 file://$PWD/report_card.html`. The template's count-up
  is frame-based (not clock-based) precisely so it completes under headless
  virtual time; if the screenshot shows a wrong score, something regressed.

### 7. Alternate: the 9:16 reveal film

The receipt is a *document*; short-video research says the viral unit is a
*sequence* — hook inside 1 second, one focal element per beat, verdict as the
payoff. The reveal builder turns the SAME card.json into a 16-second looping
9:16 film the user simply screen-records:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_reveal_html.py card.json --out reveal.html [--theme theme.json]
```

Beat map (fixed, research-tuned): **HOOK** 0-1.5s ("Will AI enslave you…") →
**STAKES** 1.5-4s (big evidence number + case №) → **DELIBERATION** 4-7s (their
own quotes flicker past) → **REVEAL** 7-10s (stamp slams + score) → **PROOF**
10-13s (worst vs best exhibit) → **END CARD** 13-16s (stamp, score, grade
chips, comment-keyword CTA — the screenshot frame), then it loops.

- Optional card.json fields: `hook`, `hook_accent` (substring tinted in the
  verdict colour), `evidence_n`/`evidence_label` (else derived from `meta`),
  `cta` (optional; omit for no call-to-action line), `site`.
- House defaults when the user hasn't said otherwise: `"site": "labs.routiq.ai/basilisk"`
  and a one-word comment keyword — `"cta": "comment BASILISK"`. Keep the keyword
  identical to the skill name so the video, the caption and the install all say
  the same word.
- Story-style progress segments run along the top; safe zones are respected
  (critical text clear of the top ~15% / bottom ~20% where platform UI sits).
- Pure-CSS loop — records fine even with JS disabled; tap restarts the cycle;
  reduced-motion and print show the end card statically.
- Tell the user: open it fullscreen in a browser, screen-record one full loop
  (16s), post the reveal as the Reel and the end-card frame as the X still.
- **Verify in a real browser** (serve the file and watch it play). Headless
  `--virtual-time-budget` screenshots are unreliable for sampling mid-cycle
  infinite CSS animations — beats can appear missing when they are fine.

## Report card format

Fill this template. Keep it TIGHT and funny — it's for a short reel, so punchy
beats thorough. Ground every line in a real stat or quote from the JSON.

```markdown
📋 **[NAME]'S AI-INTERACTION REPORT CARD**

*[one savage-but-affectionate one-line summary]*

| Category | Grade | Evidence |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Manners / "Please" count | ? | [please+plz count, pct_messages_softened] |
| Gratitude | ? | [gratitude_to_assistant count — usually the brutal one] |
| Patience | ? | [just_count + a real "just do it" quote] |
| Temper Control | ? | [genuine_wtf count; bluntest real quote] |
| Spelling & Typing | ? | [3-5 real typos, verbatim, from the sample] |
| Teamwork / "we" framing | ? | [pct_messages_collaborative + a "we" quote] |
| Emotional Range | ? | [warmest quote vs spiciest quote] |

**Teacher's Comments:** [2-3 funny sentences in a report-card-teacher voice.]

**OVERALL: X / 10** — [funny, fair justification]

*— [tiny stamp line]*
```

## Grading guidance (be fair, be funny)

- Someone who says please a lot but never thanks the assistant = high Manners,
  failing Gratitude. That contrast is the funniest, truest beat — lead with it.
- Blunt corrections ("no we…", "wtf why were there two") are *not* cruelty; grade
  Temper Control generously unless there are real insults aimed at the assistant.
- Typos are affectionate colour, not a real failing — grade playfully.
- Land the overall score honestly. Genuinely-polite-but-never-grateful tends to
  sit around 7–8/10. Don't inflate to a 10; the honesty is what makes it land.
