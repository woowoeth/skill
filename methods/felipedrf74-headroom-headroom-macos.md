  Native SwiftUI rules for Headroom, a macOS menu-bar app that shows Grok,
  Claude, OpenAI/Codex, and Cursor subscription quotas. Use when editing
  Headroom, MenuBarExtra, provider adapters, popover meters, tokens, Keychain
  or CLI credential reads, or when the user runs /headroom-macos.

# Headroom macOS

Community menu-bar extra. Glance first. Apple-native, not a web page. Bundle ID `app.headroom.mac`.

## Tokens (single source)

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Material | `.menu` / `.popover` | Popover chrome |
| Ink | `Color.primary` | Names, healthy numbers |
| Mute | `Color.secondary` | Captions, timestamps |
| Track | `Color.primary.opacity(0.12)` | Empty meter |
| Fill | `Color.primary.opacity(0.85)` | Healthy used-bar |
| Tight | `#C47A2C` | Remaining ≤ 25% |
| Critical | `#C23B22` | Remaining ≤ 10% |
| Stale | secondary at 0.55 opacity | Last-good after a failed refresh |
| Menu type | 10pt caption + 12pt semibold % | World Clock columns |
| Popover name | system 13 semibold | `Grok` |
| Popover % | system 22 medium, tabular | `42%` |
| Caption | system 11 regular, secondary | `Weekly · resets in 3d 4h` |
| Meter | height 8, corner radius 6 | Used fill only |
| Rhythm | 8 pt | Card padding 12, gap 10 |

Memorable element: compact extra — brand glyph + tabular %, or iStat-style vertical used-bars. Names live in the popover. No status dot. Keep it narrow so macOS 27 does not park it behind the overflow chevron.

`HeadroomTokens.ink(remaining:isStale:)` owns popover percent color. Menu-bar type uses `Color.primary` only. Do not duplicate thresholds.

## Menu bar

Enabled + connected providers only:

```
  Percents:  [glyph] 2%   [glyph] 9%   [glyph] 32%
  Meters:    [glyph]|     [glyph]|     [glyph]|
```

`AppSettings.menuStyle` is Percents or Meters. Meters are iStat-style vertical capsules with a 1pt outline so remaining quota is visible. Fill from the bottom = used %. Fill color uses `HeadroomTokens.meterFill`. No leading health dot. Menu-bar marks are template logos (`GlyphBuild` Grok slash-G / `GlyphBot` face / `GlyphGPT` blossom) plus paths for Claude and Cursor. Photographed app icons stay in the popover via `ProviderIcon`. Short names: Build, Bot, Claude, GPT, Cursor. Loading uses `–%`. Signed-out / expired providers are omitted. Never hide an enabled connected provider.

The extra is an **AppKit `NSStatusItem`** hosting `MenuBarLabel` in a passthrough `NSHostingView`. Click opens an `NSPopover`. Settings is `AppDelegate.openSettings`. `LSUIElement`. Install to `/Applications/Headroom.app`.

## Providers

Protocol `ProviderClient.fetch() async -> Result<QuotaSnapshot, ProviderError>`. Parallel refresh. One failure never blocks the others. Credentials are read in place and never copied into Headroom storage or logs. Cache is percentages, reset times, and provider names only.

| Extra | Primary meter | Label | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Grok Build | Weekly pool | Weekly | `~/.grok/auth.json` | Missing `creditUsagePercent` on a weekly unified period means 0. Refresh OIDC via `https://auth.x.ai/oauth2/token`. Sign in runs `grok login --device-auth`. |
| Grok Bot | Weekly pool | Weekly | Cursor `state.vscdb` token | `POST …/GetSandUsageStatus`. Separate from Grok Build. Sign in opens Grok Bot (`com.anysphere.sand`), then Cursor. Wait on a readable access token, not `state.vscdb` mtime (WAL writes do not bump the main file). |
| Claude | 7-day window | Weekly | Keychain `Claude Code-credentials` via `/usr/bin/security` | Refresh expired OAuth at `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`. 5-hour window is popover-only. Sign in runs `claude auth login`. |
| OpenAI | Weekly window | Weekly | `~/.codex/auth.json` | If `secondary_window` is null, a `primary_window` with `limit_window_seconds >= 6 days` is the weekly meter. Sign in runs `codex login --device-auth`. |
| Cursor | `max(auto%, api%)` | This cycle | Cursor `state.vscdb` | Monthly billing cycle, never “Weekly”. Sign in opens Cursor. |

Timeout 8s. 401/403 → expired. Independent last-good cache in `~/Library/Application Support/Headroom/`. Coalesce overlapping refreshes. Persist the snapshot cache once per cycle. Reuse the Cursor token for Grok Bot within 20s. Reuse a non-expired Claude keychain read.

Signed-out cards show a **Sign In** button. Settings → Accounts shows connection status. Turning a provider off does not log the user out of that provider. If a session is already usable, Sign In finishes immediately instead of waiting.

Popover icons load through `HeadroomImage` (`NSImage` from the asset catalog or loose `Resources` PNGs). SwiftUI `Image("name")` alone misses files that are not in an `.car`. Menu-bar glyphs fall back to Canvas marks if the PNG is missing. Meter fill is clipped to the track capsule; 0% used draws no fill.

## Copy

No apologies. Errors start with “Couldn't…”. Sign-in lines name the real command (`grok login`, `claude login`, `codex login`, “Sign in to Grok Bot”, “Sign in to Cursor”).

## Verify

Running `Headroom.app`: five live percentages when signed in (Build + Bot distinct), Sign In on a signed-out card, popover icons and meters, disable a provider, dark and light. A missing credential does not blank the others. Source, fixtures, logs, and `snapshots.json` contain no emails, names, or tokens.
