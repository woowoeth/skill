description: Manage git worktrees across any repository with the `gwm` Rust binary (CLI + ratatui TUI). Use when the user asks to create / list / remove / bootstrap / switch / link worktrees, run a command across worktrees (`gwm exec`) or reclaim build artifacts (`gwm clean`), materialise a PR into a worktree (`gwm review`), drive a multi-repo workspace (`--workspace`), run the JSON daemon / statusline (`gwm daemon`, `gwm statusline`), list or pin AI-agent sessions per worktree (`gwm agents`, Claude Code / Codex / opencode / Mistral Vibe detection), seed config from a preset (`gwm init --preset`), diagnose with `gwm doctor`, drive tmux/zellij, or wire `gcd` via `gwm shell-init`. Also covers multi-forge (#419): GitHub via `gh` **or** GitLab via `glab`, the `forge` / `[forge_hosts]` keys, and `gwm trust add`. Triggers on `gwm`, `gwq`, `git worktree`, `.gwm.toml`, `forge`, `forge_hosts`, `glab`, `gwm trust add`, GitLab MR, `gwm create`, `gwm list`, `gwm exec`, `gwm clean`, `gwm review`, `gwm daemon`, `gwm statusline`, `gwm agents`, `gwm note`, `gwm bootstrap`, `gwm doctor`, `gwm switch`, `gwm tmux`, `gwm zellij`, `gwm link`, `gwm status`, `gwm shell-init`, `gcd`, `feat/#`, `fix/#`, GitHub issue/PR linking on a worktree.

# gwm: git worktree manager (Rust CLI + TUI)

Single-binary Rust tool that manages git worktrees with `libgit2`, a ratatui TUI, a declarative per-repo bootstrap (`.gwm.toml`), GitHub issue/PR linking, multiplexer hand-off (tmux / zellij), and a doctor command. Replaces project-specific bash wrappers with one portable binary that works in any git repo.

Source: https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli, latest stable **`1.9.0`** (machine contracts frozen since 1.0.0, MSRV 1.95).

**1.9.0 is the licensing line, and it changes nothing you call.** gwm is dual-licensed **MIT OR Apache-2.0**: MIT stays in full under `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE` joins it for its §3 patent grant, and a user picks either without having to say which. Both texts travel in every artefact (release archives, `.deb`, `.rpm`, AUR, the published crate). The libraries statically compiled in ship their notices under `third-party/`: libgit2 (GPLv2 with a linking exception, which is conditional on the notice travelling) and zlib. Behaviour-wise the line is what gwm prints: 165 em dashes rewritten across the binary's string literals and 49 more in `gwm --help`, so an error message or a completion script no longer carries a character the docs dropped; the Settings panel sizes to its active tab instead of a flat 60% of the frame; and a worktree path is spelled one way everywhere it is printed in full, `~` for `$HOME`, in the TUI header, the table and the sidebar alike (`gwm path --format=json` stays absolute).

**1.8.0 is the density line, and it changes a default.** The TUI is **compact** unless told otherwise: panes and sidebar sections carry no box rule, each is delimited by a filled one-line header (uppercase title with its bracketed key, counter pinned right on the same line), a `muted` rule separates the two panes, and the worktrees pane sizes itself to its row count instead of reserving a share of the split. That is two rows and two columns back per section. Focus reads on the header, which takes the `focus` role and the `selection_bg` fill, so the border is no longer the focus cue. `[tui] layout = "bordered"` restores gwm's pre-1.8 frames verbatim and is left untouched by the compact refinements. Two knobs ride along, both applying under either layout: `[tui] status_one_line` (**on by default**) folds the sidebar Status block onto one row joined by ` · `, leaving the path its own row; `[tui] dim_unfocused` (off) dims the inactive pane's body via the terminal's `DIM` attribute. A new theme role, `section_bg`, paints the compact header fill: an indexed colour, not a translucent white, so the mode holds up without truecolor, and distinct from `selection_bg` in every preset because that difference is what separates a focused header from an unfocused one. Overlays and modals keep their border either way, and their width now comes from one policy (`modal_width(term_width, pct, min, max)`) rather than the four it used to be, two of which got narrower as the terminal widened.

**Per-worktree notes, shipped in 1.7.0 (#515).** `N` opens the selected worktree's note in an editable modal (`Esc` writes and closes; `Ctrl+e` hands the same file to `$EDITOR`: `editor_cmd`, then `$EDITOR`, then `vi`, the handoff `o` uses in `mode = "editor"`), and the table carries a binary markdown marker (`nf-oct-markdown`, captioning its own column since #595) on the rows that have one. Notes are plain Markdown at `<main-checkout>/.git/gwm/notes/<branch>.md`: greppable with gwm shut down, never committed, and they survive `gwm remove`, which is why they live in the main checkout rather than in the worktree. `gwm note show [slug]` prints one and exits 1 when there is none; the `--format=json` rows carry it in an additive `note` field. The note is keyed on the branch, so a detached row cannot carry one (and says so), a rename moves the file, and `gwm doctor` reports a note whose branch is gone (not `gwm clean`, whose `--yes` only ever removes directories git already ignores). Presence means non-blank, since `vi` over an empty buffer writes one byte. `N` was unbound before, so a `.gwm.toml` binding a chord starting with `N` is now a prefix conflict refused at load time.

**Security, 1.6.0 (GHSA-fffq-vg6f-gxqm, high).** Every version up to and including 1.5.0 expanded lifecycle-hook placeholders into `sh -c` unescaped, so a branch name carrying `;` / `|` / `$` / backticks (all legal in a git ref, and a branch can arrive from someone else's push) ran arbitrary commands as the user, with no trust prompt in the path: the TOFU gate covers the repo's hooks, never the branch name flowing into them. Values are shell-escaped on expansion in 1.6.0, and hooks also get their context as `GWM_*` environment variables, which need no quoting at all. No backport: upgrade.

**Free-form naming, shipped in 1.6.0 (#416 / #418).** `gwm create --name spike-redis` skips the `<type> <issue> <desc>` triple; the name becomes the branch verbatim, so `branch_pattern` / `path_pattern` do not apply and branch-name-derived features (issue auto-linking, gitmoji) stay inactive on it, with `gwm link` as the way back. The TUI create and rename forms present the fields the repo's own patterns ask for, in pattern order, instead of the canonical triple, and move between the structured and free-form shapes in both directions.

**Multi-forge, shipped in 1.5.0 (#419).** Issue / PR lookups go through a `Forge` trait with two backends: GitHub via `gh`, GitLab via `glab`. `forge = "github" | "gitlab"` in `.gwm.toml` names the backend; `[forge_hosts]` in the **user-level** config authorises a self-hosted host; `gwm trust add` is the per-repo alternative. Worktrees, bootstrap, branch naming and link storage are forge-neutral: only the network layer knows which forge is in play. See [Forge selection](#forge-selection-github--gitlab).

Shipped since 1.0.0: **per-worktree notes** (`N`, #515), the **rich PR / issue view** (`I`, #420 + its inline review comments #528), **container execution** on an `exec` profile (#421), **multi-row selection** with a batch delete (`Space` + `d`, #484), the **`symfony` preset** (#392), and a TUI delete that finally runs the remove hooks and records the undo journal (#521 / #531), all in 1.7.0; **free-form naming** in 1.6.0 (#416 / #418, above) alongside its security fix; **multi-forge** in 1.5.0 (#419, above); the **help overlay** (`?`, complete by construction: every `Action` must appear, #453) and a trio of TUI polish items in 1.4.0; **agent session detection** in 1.3.0 (#408): per-worktree AI-agent sessions (Claude Code, Codex, opencode, Mistral Vibe) read from on-disk artefacts, no process scanning, surfaced as `gwm agents [attach|detach]`, a conditional AGENT column, an `a` overlay, a pinned-only Agents sidebar pane and multi-pins in branch config (`gwm-agent-pin`); plus the **Windows daemon** over a named pipe (#439). 1.0.0 shipped: `gwm exec` / `gwm clean` (#313), `gwm review <PR#>` (#308), the JSON API + `gwm daemon` + `gwm statusline` (#38 / #309), `gwm init --preset` (#37), multi-repo `--workspace` (#36), embedded PTY overlays (#35), a rebindable keymap incl. contextual modal keys + a live Settings panel with a Keys tab (#290 / #219 / #294), a Working Tree pane and a current-PR CI indicator (#300 / #299).

## When to use this skill

- User runs or asks about any `gwm <subcommand>`: `init` (incl. `--preset`), `list` (incl. `--format json`), `create`, `remove`, `path` / `cd`, `bootstrap`, `sync`, `prune`, `doctor`, `types`, `completions`, `shell-init`, `switch` (alias `s`), `tmux`, `zellij`, `link`, `unlink`, `open`, `status`, `exec`, `clean`, `review`, `daemon`, `statusline`, `agents`, `new`, `pr`, `config`, `history`, `undo`, `trust`, `labels`, `milestones`, `hooks`, `commit-prefix`, `aliases`, `theme`, `tui keys`. `trust` takes `add | list | revoke | show`.
- User wants to **fan a command out across worktrees** (`gwm exec -- <cmd>`) or **reclaim build artifacts** (`gwm clean`).
- User wants to **materialise a GitHub PR into a worktree** to review/test it (`gwm review <PR#>`, cross-fork, safe-by-default).
- User wants a **multi-repo workspace** (`gwm --workspace <dir>`), the **JSON API / daemon** (`--format=json`, `gwm daemon`, `gwm statusline` for shell prompts), or **stack presets** (`gwm init --preset laravel|node|rust|go|python-uv|generic`).
- User asks **which AI agents are working where**: `gwm agents` (per-worktree sessions + an `unmatched` section), `gwm agents attach <wt> <id>` / `detach <wt> [<id>]` (multi-pins), the TUI `a` overlay (select `j`/`k`, pin `a`, unpin `d`, attach-by-id `i`), the pinned-only `Agents` sidebar pane, or the `GWM_AGENTS_HOME` test seam.
- User opens the TUI by running `gwm` alone in a repo, or the picker via `gwm switch` / `gwm s`.
- User wants to **delete several worktrees at once**: `Space` to mark rows in the TUI then `d` (#484), or `gwm remove a b c` from the shell.
- User wants to **write down where they were** on a worktree: `N` in the TUI opens its note in an editable modal (#515), `gwm note show` reads it back, `gwm doctor` reports the ones whose branch is gone.
- User asks about the redesigned TUI: PTY overlays (`l`/`L` lazygit, `r`/`R` review, `o`/`O` shell, #35), the Settings panel (`4`) and its live-editable Keys tab (#294), the Command Logs modal (`3`), the Working Tree file-explorer pane (#300), the current-PR CI indicator (#299), `[tui.keys.modal.<context>]` rebindable overlay keys (#219), and `[tui.macro1]`/`[tui.macro2]` (`h`/`H`).
- User mentions `.gwm.toml` (per-repo config) or any of its sections: `[worktree]`, `[doctor]`, `[tui]`, `[tui.open]`, `[git_tui]`, `[review]`, `[[bootstrap.copy]]`, `[[bootstrap.guard]]`, `[[bootstrap.no_symlink]]`, `[[bootstrap.command]]`, `[bootstrap.fallback.*]`.
- User asks about composable `when` predicates (`file_exists:`, `cmd_exists:`, `env_set:`, `env_eq:`, `glob_exists:`) and the `!` / `&&` / `||` operators.
- User wants to migrate a `tools/worktree-manager.sh` or `gwq`-based workflow to `gwm`.
- User asks how to set up the AWS RDS guard, the safe `.env.testing` fallback, or the no-symlink invariant for `vendor/` / `node_modules/`.
- User asks about the branch convention `<type>/#<issue>-<desc>` or its overrides.
- User wants to link a worktree to a GitHub issue / PR, refresh GitHub status from inside the TUI, or run `gwm doctor` to validate setup before pushing.
- User mentions `gcd <pattern>` (shell wrapper from `gwm shell-init <shell>`).
- User wants tmux / zellij hand-off (`gwm tmux <pat>`, `gwm zellij <pat>` with optional `--split`).
- User wants to configure the TUI `l` (git_tui) / `R` (review) launchers, the `o` (open dispatch: shell/editor/finder), or `y` (yank path to clipboard) keys.
- User asks about the `branch.<n>.gwm-base` key (review base-resolution anchor) or any of the `lumen` / `claude` / `codex` / `aider` / `gh` review presets.

## Prerequisites

```bash
command -v gwm           # required — installed by `cargo install --path .` from the gwm-cli repo
command -v cargo         # required at install time (1.95+ — the crate MSRV)
command -v git           # required at runtime
command -v gh            # OPTIONAL — the GitHub backend: live `gwm status`, TUI state, `R: review` preset
command -v glab          # OPTIONAL — the GitLab backend (forge = "gitlab"); $GWM_GLAB overrides it
command -v tmux          # OPTIONAL — needed by `gwm tmux`
command -v zellij        # OPTIONAL — needed by `gwm zellij` (≥ 0.40 for `--cwd` on new-tab)
command -v lazygit       # OPTIONAL — default `[git_tui]` binary backing the TUI `l` key
command -v lumen         # OPTIONAL — `[review] tool = "lumen"` preset (default review tool)
command -v claude        # OPTIONAL — `[review] tool = "claude"` preset
command -v codex         # OPTIONAL — `[review] tool = "codex"` preset
command -v aider         # OPTIONAL — `[review] tool = "aider"` preset
command -v pbcopy        # OPTIONAL — TUI `y: yank` on macOS (wl-copy/xclip/xsel on Linux, clip on Windows)
```

`gwm` vendors `libgit2`, so no system git2 lib is needed. The binary is self-contained once compiled.

## Install (from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli.git
cd gwm-cli
cargo install --path .         # → ~/.cargo/bin/gwm
gwm --version
```

No Rust toolchain at hand? `cargo binstall gwm-cli` pulls the prebuilt binary from the matching GitHub Release (via `[package.metadata.binstall]`) and drops it in `~/.cargo/bin/` without compiling `git2`/vendored-libgit2 from source: much faster on first install.

Prebuilt releases (Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS Intel/Apple Silicon, Windows): https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/releases. A Homebrew formula ships under `packaging/homebrew/` and a Nix `flake.nix` is at the repo root.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|:---------|:-------|
| `GWM_GH` / `GWM_GLAB` | Override the forge CLI binary (path or name). Read once, on the thread that resolves the forge, so the TUI's background fetch never races env mutation. |
| `GWM_ALLOW_BOOTSTRAP=1` | Same as `--allow-bootstrap`: skip the TOFU prompt. Also satisfies the forge host gate ; same ledger, same decision. |
| `GWM_TRUST_LEDGER` | Path to the trust ledger (default `~/.config/gwm/trust.toml`). |
| `GWM_NO_GLOBAL_CONFIG=1` | Ignore the user-level `~/.config/gwm/config.toml`; repo-only config. |
| `GWM_HISTORY_FILE` | Path to the destructive-op journal backing `gwm history` / `gwm undo`. |
| `GWM_AGENTS_HOME` | Override the home scanned for agent session artefacts (test seam). |

Two **global** flags apply before or after any subcommand: `--allow-bootstrap` (skip the TOFU prompt: for CI and other non-interactive runs) and `--deny-bootstrap` (refuse bootstrap even when the ledger says trusted: for a first look at an unfamiliar repo). `--workspace <DIR>` is global too.

## Default conventions

| What                | Default                              | Override                       |
|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| Branch name         | `<type>/#<issue>-<desc>`             | `.gwm.toml` `branch_pattern`   |
| Worktree dir name   | `<type>-<issue>-<desc>`              | `.gwm.toml` `path_pattern`     |
| Worktree base       | `~/cc-worktree/<repo>/`              | `.gwm.toml` `base`             |
| Bootstrap           | none (just `git worktree add`)       | `.gwm.toml` `[bootstrap.*]`    |
| Doctor trunks       | `["dev", "main"]`                    | `.gwm.toml` `[doctor] trunks`  |
| TUI confirm timer   | `3` (clamped 0..=5)                  | `.gwm.toml` `[tui] confirm_countdown_secs` |

Branch types: `feat`, `fix`, `hotfix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`.

Placeholders in patterns: `{home}`, `{repo}` (repo name), `{repo_path}` (main repo's absolute workdir), `{repo_parent}` (its parent dir), `{type}`, `{issue}`, `{desc}`. Tilde (`~/…`) is also expanded.

### `gwm doctor`

Runs a structured set of checks across config, environment, and worktree state. Designed for CI / pre-commit hooks:

| Exit | Meaning                                                                  |

| `0`  | All checks green                                                         |
| `1`  | At least one **warning** (advisory, e.g. orphan gwm-style branch)        |
| `2`  | At least one **failure** (broken config, prunable worktree, etc.)        |

Trunk branches the orphan-branch check treats as merge destinations come from `[doctor] trunks = [...]` (default `["dev", "main"]`). Setting `trunks = []` disables the filter (every unclaimed gwm-style branch is flagged).

One of the warnings is an **orphan note** (#515): a note under `.git/gwm/notes/` whose branch no longer exists. This is the only place the note lifecycle is enforced, on purpose. `gwm clean` does not touch notes: its stated safety property is that `--yes` only removes directories git already ignores, and prose is neither regenerable nor ignored.

### `gwm shell-init` → `gcd <pattern>`

The emitted wrapper defines a `gcd` function that resolves a worktree by fuzzy pattern and `cd`s into it in one keystroke. Install per shell:

```bash
# zsh
echo 'eval "$(gwm shell-init zsh)"'  >> ~/.zshrc
# bash
echo 'eval "$(gwm shell-init bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
# fish
gwm shell-init fish | source        # also add the eval to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
# powershell
Invoke-Expression (& gwm shell-init powershell | Out-String)
```

`gcd` (no arg) launches `gwm switch` (the picker) and `cd`s into the chosen entry.

### Forge selection (GitHub / GitLab)

Two backends implement the same `Forge` trait: **GitHub** via `gh`, **GitLab** via `glab` (which says *MR* where GitHub says *PR*). Everything else, worktrees, bootstrap, branch naming, the `branch.<n>.gwm-*` link storage: is forge-neutral.

**Which backend.** Inferred from the `origin` host for the vendors' own domains (`github.com`, `ghe.com`, `gitlab.com`). A self-hosted instance lives on an arbitrary domain and cannot be detected from a URL, so name it:

```toml
# .gwm.toml
forge = "gitlab"     # or "github"
```

The key always wins over inference, in both directions.

**Which hosts may be called.** A separate question, with a separate answer: `forge` names the backend, it does not authorise a host. On a host gwm does not recognise, authorisation comes from one of:

```toml
# ~/.config/gwm/config.toml — YOUR file, never shipped with a repo
[forge_hosts]
"gitlab.acme.com" = "gitlab"
"ghe.acme.com"    = "github"
```

```bash
gwm trust add        # …or approve this one repo's .gwm.toml, in the repo, once
```

Per host (not one blanket key) so a mixed fleet: self-hosted GitLab *and* GitHub Enterprise: is describable in one config. Host matching is case-insensitive, and keyed on the host **without** the port.

Why the split: `gh` and `glab` forward whatever token is in the environment to whatever host they are pointed at, with no scoping of their own. Reading a bare `forge` key as authorisation meant one global setting authorised every host in existence, including one an attacker put in a clone's `origin`. The refusal message prints the exact `[forge_hosts]` key to add.

`GWM_ALLOW_BOOTSTRAP=1` satisfies this gate too: same ledger, same file, same decision.

### Forge linking (`link` / `unlink` / `open` / `status`)

Links live in **per-branch git config**:

- `branch.<name>.gwm-issue` ← `gwm link issue <N>`
- `branch.<name>.gwm-pr`    ← `gwm link pr <N>`
- `branch.<name>.gwm-base`  ← _written by `gwm create`_: anchors the `[review].{base}` resolution chain so the parent ref survives even when the branch has no upstream yet. Not user-facing; surfaces only via the `R: review` launcher.

Local, per-branch, survives worktree moves. Issue numbers are auto-detected from the `<type>/#<N>-<slug>` convention when no explicit override is set; PR numbers are **not** auto-detected and must be linked explicitly.

`gwm status` shells out to the resolved backend (`gh issue view` / `gh pr view`, or `glab issue view` / `glab mr view`) to fetch state, title, labels, and the CI rollup. GitLab hangs one `head_pipeline` off an MR rather than GitHub's per-check array, so the MR collapses to a single synthetic check. Without the backend CLI on `$PATH`, it prints only the local link. `--json` emits a stable schema for scripting.

The backend a link was written under is recorded per branch; flipping `forge` drops the other backend's numbers rather than resolving issue #42 as merge request !42 on the other forge: a real page, the wrong one.

### Multiplexer hand-off (`tmux` / `zellij`)

- `gwm tmux <pat>` requires `$TMUX` to be set (i.e. you are already inside a tmux session): otherwise it exits non-zero with a clear error rather than spawning a stray server. `--split` opens a horizontal split of the current pane instead of a new window.
- `gwm zellij <pat>` requires `$ZELLIJ`. `--cwd` on `zellij action new-tab` needs zellij ≥ 0.40. `--split` opens a new pane in the current tab instead of a new tab.

## Status column

The TUI table and `gwm list` both expose a `STATUS` column:

| label              | meaning                                                         | colour       |
|:-------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------|
| `clean`            | no upstream, no changes                                          | green        |
| `✓ synced`         | upstream set, no ahead/behind, no local changes                  | green        |
| `● dirty`          | uncommitted changes (working tree or index)                      | yellow       |
| `↑N`               | N commits ahead of upstream                                      | cyan         |
| `↓M`               | M commits behind upstream                                        | yellow       |
| `↑N ↓M`            | both                                                             | yellow       |
| `● dirty ↑N`       | combined indicators                                              | yellow       |
| `locked`           | linked worktree is locked (git2 reports it)                      | magenta      |
| `prunable`         | working tree dir is missing ; run `gwm prune`                    | red          |
| `unknown`          | status couldn't be computed (detached HEAD, IO error, etc.)      | dark gray    |

## TUI key map

Built-in defaults after the **v0.10 keymap redesign (#290)**, plus the `Space` /
`z` swap that made room for the row mark (#484). Every binding is
rebindable via `[tui.keys]` (list view) and `[tui.keys.modal.<context>]`
(overlays, #219). One upgrade note: `z` is now a shipped default, so a
`.gwm.toml` binding a chord that *starts* with `z` (`top = ["z z"]`) is a prefix
conflict and is refused at load time, and the same now goes for `N` (#515).
Run `gwm tui keys` for the full resolved map incl. every modal
context.

| Key             | Action                                                                      |
|:----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `j`/`↓` `k`/`↑` | move selection (scrolls the focused pane)                                    |
| `gg` / `G`·End  | jump to first / last worktree                                               |
| `Tab`           | swap focus between the worktree list and the Status sidebar                  |
| `1` / `2`       | focus the worktrees pane / the Status pane                                  |
| `3` / `4`       | open the Command Logs modal / the Settings (config) panel (#290 / #294)     |
| `n` / `d` / `b` | new worktree modal / delete the marked rows (or the cursor row) / re-run bootstrap (TOFU gate) |
| `Space`         | mark / unmark the cursor row for the bulk delete (#484); only `d` reads the set |
| `N`             | edit the selected worktree's note in a modal (#515); a markdown glyph marks the rows that have one |
| `D`             | toggle "delete branch on remove" (arms the safety countdown when ON)        |
| `p` / `P`       | pull / push the selected worktree's branch                                  |
| `s` / `f`       | sync (fetch + rebase) / refresh the worktree list                           |
| `c` / `e`       | edit-worktree / exit-to-worktree (sets the picker's cd target)             |
| `l` / `L`       | lazygit ; PTY overlay / fullscreen `[git_tui]` (#35)                        |
| `r` / `R`       | `[review]` launcher ; PTY overlay / fullscreen (#35 / #75)                  |
| `o` / `O`       | terminal (`$SHELL`) ; PTY overlay / fullscreen honouring `[tui.open]` (#35) |
| `t`             | open the worktree in a tmux/zellij pane (mux)                              |
| `h` / `H`       | run `[tui.macro1]` / `[tui.macro2]` (#290)                                  |
| `y` / `w` / `Y` | yank branch name / worktree name / absolute path to the clipboard           |
| `i` / `B`       | link prompt (issue/PR) / browse-links menu (open linked issue·PR in browser)|
| `a`             | agent sessions overlay (#408) ; `j`/`k` select, `a` pin, `d` unpin, `i` attach-by-id, `Esc` close; the sidebar `Agents` pane shows pinned sessions only |
| `I`             | rich PR / issue view (#420) ; description, author, branch pair, diff size, CI rollup, submitted reviews, conversation, and the comments anchored to a diff hunk (#528, a second GraphQL request fired when the view opens). `Enter` opens the selected row's URL, `f` re-fetches. On GitLab: summary, description, author and branch pair only |
| `x`             | exec profile picker (#325) ; pick a `[exec.profiles.<name>]` and run it in a PTY. A profile carrying a `[container]` block runs inside `docker run` / `podman run` with `-i -t` (#421) |
| `F`             | refresh GitHub issue/PR status via `gh` (off-thread; statusbar spinner)     |
| `V` / `v`       | toggle the sidebar / flip its position left ↔ right                         |
| `S` / `z`       | sidebar Details mode (commits ↔ stashes) / cycle layout (auto→side→stacked; `Space` before #484) |
| `.` / `?`       | open the docs in `$BROWSER` / help overlay                                  |
| `:` / `/`       | command palette (fuzzy-fire any action) / fuzzy filter bar (`Esc` clears)   |
| `Enter`         | show path in status bar (picker mode: print path to stdout + exit)          |
| `q` / `Esc`     | quit (`Esc` closes an overlay / clears a sticky filter first)               |
| `Ctrl-C`        | force quit                                                                  |

PTY overlays (`l`/`r`/`o`) run the tool **inside** the TUI (no alt-screen swap;
`Esc` closes); the uppercase variants (`L`/`R`/`O`) suspend the TUI for a
fullscreen takeover. The Settings panel (`4`) edits `.gwm.toml` live across
category tabs (Theme / Worktree / TUI / Keys / All) with a per-layer selector
(`L`); the **Keys** tab captures a keystroke and writes it back validated (#294).

## Picker mode (`gwm switch` / `gcd`)

`gwm switch` opens the same TUI minus the create / delete / bootstrap actions. The fuzzy filter bar opens immediately so typing narrows the list right away. `Enter` commits the highlighted pick (path → stdout). `Esc` / `Ctrl-C` / `q` exit non-zero without printing.

## Details sidebar

When the sidebar is open (default ON, toggle with `v`), it shows a details panel for the selected worktree. The layout is responsive (issue #188): at ≥ 120 columns it sits **side-by-side** with the table; below that it **stacks** under the table (it is no longer hidden). `z` cycles `auto → side-by-side → stacked → auto` (`Space` before #484, `V` before #290); `v` flips the side-by-side position left ↔ right, with the default set by `[tui] sidebar_position = "left" | "right"` (default `right`). Since the lazygit-style redesign (issues #69 / #71 / #73) the panel is **four independent subsections** stacked vertically, with no outer `Details` frame and no inline `Label:` content headers. Under the default `compact` layout each subsection is delimited by a filled header line; under `layout = "bordered"` each carries a rounded border with its title on the rule, which is what the panel looked like up to 1.7.

Worktree block: name (bold) prefixed by the `●` dot · `branch · short-head` (branch coloured by `BranchStatus`, worst-state wins: dirty=red, ahead/behind=yellow, unpublished=magenta, synced=green, unknown=darkgray) · `Created: <age>` with freshness colour (green < 7d, yellow < 30d, darkgray ≥ 30d; `-` when undeterminable, e.g. trunk / detached HEAD) · status + flag badges (only the relevant ones: false flags stay invisible: `★ main`, `🔒 locked`, `⚠ prunable`) · tilde-compressed path.

GitHub fetch state machine per worktree: `Idle → Loading → Loaded(T) | Error(String)`. Manual refresh = `F` (the legacy `R` was rebound to `R: review` in #75).

An `Agents` block (issue #408) sits between Issue / PR and Working Tree when at least one session is **pinned** to the selected worktree: one line per pinned session (agent · freshness · last activity · name), collapsed entirely otherwise; the full detected list lives in the `a` overlay. The main table grows a conditional `AGENT` column (top session per worktree) only when a session is detected.

`Tab` swaps focus between the worktree list and the sidebar. `j` / `k` (and arrows) scroll the Recent Commits block when the sidebar is focused: the small blocks above stay pinned. The focused panel's border turns cyan.

## Terminal open: `o` (PTY overlay) / `O` (fullscreen): issues #73 / #35

Since the keymap redesign, `o` opens an **embedded PTY terminal overlay** inside
the TUI (no alt-screen swap; `Esc` closes), while `O` is the **fullscreen**
variant that suspends the TUI and honours the `[tui.open]` dispatch below. Three
fullscreen modes:

| `mode = ` | Behaviour                                                                                  |
|:----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"shell"` _(default)_ | Suspend the TUI and spawn `$SHELL` with `cwd = <worktree>` ; lazygit-style. Exiting the shell restores the TUI. |
| `"editor"` | Suspend the TUI and run `$EDITOR <worktree-path>`.                                        |
| `"finder"` | Hand off to the OS file manager (`open` / `xdg-open` / `explorer`).                       |

```toml
[tui.open]
mode       = "shell"     # "shell" (default) | "editor" | "finder"
shell_cmd  = ""          # override $SHELL when set ("" = read $SHELL)
editor_cmd = "hx"        # override $EDITOR when set ("" = read $EDITOR)
```

`shell_cmd` and `editor_cmd` win over the env var when non-empty. An unknown `mode` is a hard config-load error.

## Yank: `y` branch · `w` worktree name · `Y` path: issues #73 / #290

The yank keys copy to the system clipboard: `y` = the branch name, `w` = the
worktree (dir) name, `Y` = the selected worktree's absolute path. Probe order
(first hit wins on `$PATH`):

| OS         | Candidates (in order)                                                              |
|:-----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| macOS      | `pbcopy`                                                                           |
| Linux      | `wl-copy`, `xclip -selection clipboard`, `xsel --clipboard --input`                |
| Windows    | `clip`                                                                             |

Missing tool surfaces a status-bar hint, never a panic. No config knob: the probe list is built per-platform.

## Configurable launchers (`l`/`L` git_tui · `r`/`R` review): issues #75 / #35

Two configurable launchers share the same mini-API: take a `command` template from `.gwm.toml`, substitute placeholders, split with `shell-words`, and exec it with `cwd = <selected-worktree>`. Each has a **PTY-overlay** binding (lowercase: runs inside the TUI, no alt-screen swap, `Esc` closes) and a **fullscreen** binding (uppercase: suspends the TUI):

| Keys (PTY / full) | Section     | Default                       | Placeholders                          | Default `fullscreen` |
|:------------------|:------------|:------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|:---------------------|
| `l` / `L`         | `[git_tui]` | `lazygit -p {path}`           | `{path}`                              | `true`               |
| `r` / `R`         | `[review]`  | _(inert until configured)_    | `{base} {head} {path} {diff}`         | `false`              |

`fullscreen = true` suspends the gwm TUI for a TUI-style takeover (same recipe as the pre-issue-#75 `l` → lazygit flow); `fullscreen = false` runs the command **synchronously in-place**: gwm stays in the alt-screen, `Command::output()` blocks the TUI until the child exits, and the first line of stderr lands on the status bar. Fine for quick print-only tools (`claude --print`, `gh pr view --web`); pick `fullscreen = true` for anything long-running so the TUI is properly suspended and restored. The `{diff}` placeholder is **lazy**: gwm only shells out to `git diff {base}..{head}` (into a tempfile) when the template references it.

### `[review]` base resolution chain (for `{base}`)

1. `branch.<name>.merge` (the branch's upstream, if any).
2. `branch.<name>.gwm-base` (recorded by `gwm create` so the parent ref survives `git push -u`).
3. `[review].default_base` from `.gwm.toml`.
4. `"dev"` (gwm's project convention).
5. `"main"` (universal git default).

### `[review].tool` built-in presets

Sugar over `command + fullscreen`. Setting both `command` and `tool` makes `command` win (the TUI surfaces the shadow on next render).

| `tool = "X"` | Resolves to                                              | `fullscreen` default |
|:-------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------|
| `lumen`      | `lumen diff {base}..{head}`                              | true (TUI)           |
| `claude`     | `claude --print 'review the diff {base}..{head}'`        | false                |
| `codex`      | `codex review {base}..{head}`                            | false                |
| `aider`      | `aider --message 'review {base}..{head}'`                | true (TUI)           |
| `gh`         | `gh pr view --web`                                       | false                |

### Worked snippets

```toml
# Switch the `l` key to gitui.
[git_tui]
command = "gitui -d {path}"

# Review with lumen (TUI), skip when nothing to review.
[review]
tool = "lumen"
skip_when_no_changes = true
# default_base = "dev"   # optional pin overriding the auto chain

# Or a free-form shell line — `command` always wins over `tool`.
[review]
command = "my-review-bot --diff-file {diff} --owner kbrdn1"
fullscreen = false
```

### `gwm doctor` integration

A configured `[review]` / `[git_tui]` binary that is not on `$PATH` surfaces as **Warning** (exit code `1`), never **Failed** (exit code `2`): both launchers are opt-in, so a CI pre-commit hook gated on `gwm doctor` keeps passing when the only red flag is a missing local-only tool.

## `.gwm.toml` schema

Drop this at the repo root (or use `gwm init` for the annotated example).

```toml
# Which backend drives issue / PR lookups. Omitted ⇒ inferred from the
# `origin` host (github.com / ghe.com / gitlab.com). On any other host this
# names the BACKEND but does not authorise the HOST — see `[forge_hosts]` in
# your user-level config, or run `gwm trust add` in the repo.

# --- named exec profiles, and running one in a container (issues #325 / #421) --
# `gwm exec --profile test` runs this; `x` in the TUI picks from the same list.

  # A `[container]` block wraps THIS PROFILE's command in `docker run` /
  # `podman run`. It rides a profile only: an inline `gwm exec -- <cmd>` still
  # runs on the host whatever the config says, because that is the frozen 1.0
  # surface.
  #
  # The mount is the substance, not the wrapper. A linked worktree's `.git` is
  # a FILE holding an absolute host path, so gwm mirrors host paths and mounts
  # the main checkout's gitdir alongside the worktree. Mounting the worktree
  # alone yields a container where `git status` answers
  # `fatal: not a git repository`. Every mounted path is declared
  # `safe.directory` through `GIT_CONFIG_*` (never the blanket `*`), since a
  # rootful Docker runs as uid 0 against a host-owned tree.
  [exec.profiles.test.container]
  image      = "rust:1.90"        # required
  # runtime  = "docker"           # auto-detected: docker first, then podman
  # extra_args = ["-e", "CI=1"]   # spliced in before the image; `--name` is refused
  # selinux_relabel = true        # suffixes gwm's own mounts with `:z`; off by default
```

`gwm exec` allocates no TTY (a terminal per container means nothing across a
fan-out); the TUI overlay spawns into a real pty and runs with `-i -t`. The
overlay also names its container (`gwm-<worktree>-<pid>-<n>`) and removes it on
close, because killing a `docker run` client leaves the container running. Any
Docker-compatible CLI works (OrbStack, Colima, Rancher Desktop, native Docker).
Refused on Windows, and for a worktree path containing a `:`, which is the
field separator of `-v source:destination`.

## Bootstrap report

Every create / bootstrap run prints (or shows in the TUI) a per-step report:

| Sigil | Status   | Meaning                                                    |
|:------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ✓     | Ok       | step ran cleanly                                           |
| ·     | Skipped  | conditional not met / dest already exists / optional miss  |
| !     | Warning  | guard fired with fallback, or symlink removed              |
| ✗     | Failed   | required step couldn't proceed                             |

A run with any ✗ should be inspected before testing inside the worktree.

## Common workflows

### Migrating from `tools/worktree-manager.sh` + gwq

1. Install: `cargo install --path /path/to/gwm-cli`
2. In each repo: `gwm init` → edit `.gwm.toml` with the project-specific copies / guards / commands.
3. Replace `./tools/worktree-manager.sh create feat 123 foo` with `gwm create feat 123 foo`.
4. Replace `gwq list` / `gwq remove` / `gwq prune` with `gwm list` / `gwm remove` / `gwm prune`.
5. Drop `gwq` from the repo's prerequisites (gwm is self-contained).
6. Wire `gcd` into your shell: `echo 'eval "$(gwm shell-init zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc`.
7. Add `gwm doctor` to CI / pre-commit to catch broken setups before push.

### Setting up the AWS RDS guard (Laravel / production-safe)

`.gwm.toml`:

```toml
[[bootstrap.copy]]
from = ".env.testing"
to   = ".env.testing"
required = true
fallback = "inline"

[bootstrap.fallback.env_testing]
target  = ".env.testing"
content = """
APP_ENV=testing
APP_KEY=
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=:memory:
CACHE_STORE=array
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
MAIL_MAILER=array
SESSION_DRIVER=array
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=4
"""

[[bootstrap.copy]]
from = ".env"
to   = ".env"
required = false
guards = ["no-prod-rds"]

[[bootstrap.guard]]
name = "no-prod-rds"
deny_patterns = ["amazonaws\\.com", "\\.rds\\.", "prod\\.flippad\\.com"]
on_match = "seed-from-example"
example_file = ".env.example"

[[bootstrap.no_symlink]]
path = "vendor"

[[bootstrap.command]]
name = "composer install"
run  = "composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist"
when = "file_exists:composer.json"
env  = { COMPOSER_IGNORE_PLATFORM_REQ = "ext-imagick" }
```

### Node project (bun preferred, npm fallback)

```toml
[[bootstrap.copy]]
from = ".env"
to   = ".env"
required = false

[[bootstrap.no_symlink]]
path = "node_modules"

[[bootstrap.command]]
name = "install (bun)"
run  = "bun install"
when = "file_exists:package.json && cmd_exists:bun"

[[bootstrap.command]]
name = "install (npm fallback)"
run  = "npm ci"
when = "file_exists:package.json && !cmd_exists:bun"
```

### Quick create + cd

```bash
gwm create feat 42 cool-thing
cd "$(gwm path cool-thing)"
# …or with the shell wrapper installed:
gcd cool-thing
```

### Picker → cd in one keystroke

```bash
# After `eval "$(gwm shell-init zsh)"`
gcd            # opens the picker; cd into the chosen worktree on Enter
```

### Hand-off into tmux / zellij

```bash
# Inside tmux:
gwm tmux api-rewrite              # new window in current session
gwm tmux api-rewrite --split      # …or split the current pane

# Inside zellij (>= 0.40):
gwm zellij api-rewrite            # new tab
gwm zellij api-rewrite --split    # …or new pane in current tab
```

### Link a worktree to a GitHub issue / PR

```bash
# Auto-detected from feat/#123-foo branches → no link needed.
gwm status                                  # shows the local link + (with gh) live state

# Explicit linking:
gwm link issue 456                          # current worktree → issue #456
gwm link pr   789  --worktree api-rewrite   # named worktree → PR #789
gwm open      pr                            # open the PR URL in $BROWSER
gwm unlink    issue                         # drop the explicit issue link

# Scripting:
gwm status --json
```

### Pre-push sanity check

```bash
gwm doctor && git push           # blocks the push on any warning/failure
```

### Opt-in pre-commit hook (contributors)

The repo ships an opt-in hook at `.githooks/pre-commit` that combines two gates:

1. **Env-dependent test pre-validation**: if any staged `tests/*.rs` file references ambient state (`assert_cmd`, `std::env::var`, `which::which`, `dirs::`, `Command::cargo_bin`), the suite is re-run under a stripped `PATH="$(dirname cargo):/usr/bin:/bin"` to catch tests that pass in a rich dev shell but fail on minimal CI.
2. **Local `gwm doctor`**: if staged files touch `.gwm.toml`, the bootstrap / doctor modules, the example config, or their tests, `gwm doctor` runs. Exit `0` is silent, `1` is advisory (commit proceeds), `2` blocks the commit. Unknown exits fail open.

Enable per-clone:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
git commit --no-verify        # bypass for one commit, sparingly
```
