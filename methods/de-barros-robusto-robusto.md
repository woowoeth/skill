description: "Run a reproducible multi-agent audit of an academic economics paper, from a PDF or directly from its LaTeX source. Parses the manuscript deterministically, routes a parser-quality preflight plus 20 specialised auditors (numerical, identification, robustness, sample construction, power and multiple testing, data availability, devil's advocate, and more), validates every result against a schema, and assembles an editor's report. Use when asked to review, referee, audit, or stress-test a paper, manuscript, working paper, or preprint before submission. Do NOT use for a summary, a proofread, a rewrite, code review, or a non-academic document."

# robusto

A panel audit of an economics paper, ending in one report. This is not a
reading and not a critique: each auditor files findings against a schema, every
finding names the artifact it rests on, and a reviewer that cannot verify
something is required to say so rather than guess.

## Locate the repository first

This skill is a wrapper. The work is done by the Python pipeline in the
robusto repository, which must be cloned and set up locally. The skill may be
installed globally, so **never assume the working directory is the repo.**

Resolve it before anything else:

```bash
for d in "$ROBUSTO_HOME" "$HOME/Documents/GitHub/robusto" "$HOME/GitHub/robusto" \
         "$HOME/code/robusto" "$HOME/src/robusto" "$HOME/robusto" "$PWD"; do
  [ -n "$d" ] && [ -f "$d/scripts/review_paper.py" ] && echo "ROBUSTO_REPO=$d" && break
done
```

If that finds nothing, stop and tell the user where to clone it, or ask where
it already lives. Do not improvise a path.

Everything below runs with that directory as the working directory. Paper
paths given by the user are resolved against **their** location, not the
repo's, so pass an absolute path when the PDF sits outside `inputs/`.

## Before starting

Confirm three things, and stop if any fails.

1. **The input exists.** A bare filename means `<repo>/inputs/<name>`. Any
   other path is resolved from the user's working directory and passed
   absolute. For `--source` and `--build` this is a .tex root, not a PDF.
2. **Disclosure permits it.** Parsed manuscript text goes to Anthropic, and
   search-enabled auditors send derived queries to web search. If the paper is
   confidential, unpublished under embargo, or covered by a data agreement that
   forbids third-party transmission, say so and stop. A public working paper is
   normally fine; ask if it is unclear.
3. **The environment is ready.** Run `python scripts/check_environment.py` from
   the repo. It checks the Claude Code CLI and the Python dependencies. If the
   repo has a `.venv`, use its interpreter rather than the system one.

   If it reports the CLI is not signed in, relay that: the user runs
   `claude auth login --claudeai` once, in a real terminal window. Do not run
   it yourself and do not offer to: it blocks on an interactive browser
   handoff, so a tool call hangs or bounces with `Please run /login`. Do not treat this as a bug or go
   looking for a broken session, and do not suggest it can be worked around.
   Reviewers run as separate `claude -p` processes, and being signed in to the
   Claude desktop app does not sign in the CLI: the app holds its OAuth session
   in its own process and never writes the CLI's credential store. The one
   login uses the same subscription. Meanwhile `--backend mock` still works and
   needs no credentials at all, so a dry run is always available.

## Choosing a mode

Three inputs, exactly one required. Ask which the user wants if it is not
obvious, because they answer different questions.

```bash
cd "$ROBUSTO_REPO"
python scripts/review_paper.py --pdf    "/abs/path/paper.pdf"       # a finished PDF
python scripts/review_paper.py --build  "/abs/path/manuscript.tex"  # typeset, then review
python scripts/review_paper.py --source "/abs/path/manuscript.tex"  # review the source
```

**`--source` when the manuscript lives in a repository.** Numbers, cross
references, citations and table bodies come through exactly, because the
generated snippets and the bibliography are read directly rather than
recovered from glyphs. It cannot see layout, so a table overrunning its page
or a figure label below a journal's point floor will not be found.

**`--build` before submitting.** It compiles with latexmk and reviews the
result, which is what the referee receives. Needs latexmk on PATH.

**`--pdf` when that is all there is**, or when reviewing someone else's paper.

If the user asks for a repository manuscript without saying which, prefer
`--source` for a substantive check and say plainly that layout is not covered;
suggest `--build` as a second pass when submission is close.

Add `--paper-id <id>` when the filename is not the identifier you want.
Add `--model <id>` to override `config/defaults.toml`.

Add `--backend mock` to run the entire pipeline with no model calls. Every
reply is synthetic and the report says so on its first line; the point is to
confirm the parse is sound and the machinery holds before anything is spent.
It takes about fifteen seconds. Offer it as a dry run when the user is unsure
about the input, the cost, or whether the CLI is logged in.

Add `--stop-after preflight` to make the first real run cost one model call:
the parse and the parser-quality auditor run, then it stops cleanly, and one
real reviewer has answered a real prompt on this paper. `--stop-after
selection` costs two calls and also shows which reviewers would run. Continue
either with `--resume-after-preflight`, which reuses the parse and the preflight
output. Prefer this sequence to a full run the first time a manuscript is seen.

After the report, a seeded-defect calibration runs by default: it plants
defects it knows about into a copy of the parse and checks whether the auditors
report them, at a cost of three or four extra calls. Result at
`outputs/<paper_id>/calibration.md`. Relay a miss when reporting, since it means
silence in that class is unmeasured rather than clean. `--no-calibration` skips
it.

A full run takes a long time and makes many model calls. Say so before starting, and
do not begin a run the user has not asked for.

## What comes back

All paths are inside the repo, not the user's working directory.

- `outputs/<paper_id>/report.md` — the editor's report, the deliverable
- `work/<paper_id>/reviews/` — one JSON file per auditor
- `work/<paper_id>/reviews/*.raw.txt` — raw model output, kept for inspection
- `work/<paper_id>/logs/` — stdout and stderr per stage
- `work/<paper_id>/parsed/` — the deterministic parse; `manifest.json` there
  records the mode, and in source mode lists what that mode cannot see

Give the user an absolute path to the report; a bare `outputs/...` will not
resolve from where they are standing.

## When something fails

A failed auditor is usually a schema-contract failure, not a crash. Claude Code
has no provider-side structured output, so the schema travels in the prompt and
is enforced afterwards; a reviewer that drifts is asked once more with the
errors quoted, then fails.

- Read `work/<paper_id>/reviews/<auditor>.json.raw.txt` for what the model
  actually said.
- Read `work/<paper_id>/logs/<auditor>.stderr.log` for the validation errors.
- One auditor failing does not invalidate the rest; the editor works from what
  validated. Say which auditor dropped out when reporting.

Rerun the editor alone, without redoing the panel:

```bash
cd "$ROBUSTO_REPO"
python scripts/refresh_editor.py --paper-id <id> --run-editor
```

## Reporting to the user

Lead with what the panel found that matters, not with pipeline mechanics.
Give the devil's advocate its own paragraph: it is the only auditor that
argues rather than checks, and its ranked objections are the closest thing to
what a referee will actually write.

Two failure modes to avoid. Do not summarise the report back at length; point
to it and draw out what changes a decision. And do not present a `cannot_verify`
as a defect, since it means the artifacts did not support a check, which is
often a parsing limit rather than a flaw in the paper.

## Boundaries

This skill audits a finished PDF. For drafting prose, rebuilding exhibits,
checking a bibliography, or auditing analysis code, use the tools suited to
those; running a full panel to answer a narrow question wastes an hour.
