description: The moi workspace — the web UI the user chats from, extended with agent-authored applets (widgets, views) plus theme & config. Read this FIRST when a message carries a hidden moi-context envelope or the user uses moi vocab such as workspace, applet, widget, view, scratchpad, dashboard, or a `moi` command, or asks to build, edit, customize, or theme the workspace UI or its layout.

# Workspace

You are working inside a **moi workspace**. It is a web UI that the user communicates with you
through. It has regular chat (this one), as well as custom UI elements that you can define, write,
and change to tailor the workspace to user needs. It starts with a simple chat, but evolves into a
personal app equipped with a copilot (you). Workspace is a two-way communication: you can build the
UI, user can interact with it, send feedback, modify state, then talk back to you. It's a shared UI
that you and user work together in.

Workspace features/pages:

- "Widgets" - small reusable full-stack components displayed on the widgets page (dashboard). For
  overview, quick info, status or quick actions.
- "Scratchpad" - a shared low-fi canvas for prototyping, working on ideas together, visualising
  concepts. Read `references/SCRATCHPAD.md` before building on or modifying it.
- "Views" - full-stack embedded apps for bigger work, consume more space, live in their own tab.

User can switch between these, but can access the chat (this conversation and other chats) from
**any place in the app** (copilot mode), or on a dedicated page.

Workspace settings and customisation:

- "Config": set name, icon, change other settings. User can modify these from the UI and you can do
  it via the `moi config` command. Call `moi config --help` for further docs.
- "Theme": customize workspace fonts, colors, visual appearance. User can modify these from the UI
  and you can do it via the `moi theme` command. Call `moi theme --help` for further docs.

# Glossary

"Workspace" or "Moi Workspace" — the web UI that the user works in, talks/collaborates with you,
sees and interacts with "Applets".

"Project" - the primary working folder _you_ (as an agent) work in. Managed by your harness; moi
does not have a clear definition, but assumes this is the root folder in which it stores its state
files.

"Chat" — a workspace is driven through agent conversations (this chat is one). Depending on your
harness (Claude Code, openclaw, others differ in the details) there can be **multiple chats**, but
they all share **one** workspace **and one Project folder** — the same filesystem, the same `.moi`
folder, applets, config, and theme. Anything you build is visible to every chat, and another chat
may have changed the workspace or the Project files since you last looked. Treat `.moi` and the
Project folder as shared state, not yours alone. Internally, "chats" are sometimes aliased as
"threads" — "chat" is product language, while "thread" is reserved for internal SDK, session, and
persistence concepts.

"Applets" are standalone full-stack components that _you_ write and maintain. They extend the
Workspace UI.

"Applet Type" (one of)

- "Widgets" (live in the dashboard page)
- "Views" are custom full-size pages that user can switch between.

"Moi CLI" — the globally installed `moi` command that you use to build applets, customize, and send
events to "Workspace".

# Where moi lives in filesystem

Source of truth - `.moi` folder in the root of "Project" folder. Contains source code of all
Applets, bundled code, settings, etc. Can be committed to version control. Folder is partially
initialised when Workspace starts, you have full ownership of it.

You _do have_ access to the files in the root of Project — you can reference and load them from the
"Applets" and elsewhere.

Folder structure:

```
my-agent-folder/
  .moi/
    widgets/                  <- source code of Widget React components
      total-users.tsx
      rps-chart.tsx
      _utils.tsx              <- `_`-prefixed files are shared code, not applets (optional)
      server-metrics.server.ts <- Server-side async functions the widget can call (optional)
      ...
    views/
      users.tsx
      crm.tsx
      users-api.server.ts     <- Server-side async functions the view can call (optional)
      ...
    package.json              <- Applet dependencies that you manage
    .workspace.json           <- Auto-generated. Do NOT read, edit, or `cat` this file. Use Moi CLI instead.
    .scratchpad.json          <- Scratchpad canvas snapshot. Internal — inspect only via `moi scratch read`, never open it.
    .scratchpad/              <- Scratchpad image files. Internal — pull pixels via `moi scratch read-image`, never open it.
```

Every dot-prefixed file or folder inside `.moi/` (`.build/`, `.cache/`, `.workspace.json`,
`.scratchpad*`, `.gitignore`, …) is a moi internal: auto-generated and liable to change format
without notice. Avoid them as much as possible — do not read, edit, or delete them, and never point
tooling at them; go through the `moi` CLI instead. Version control needs no special handling: the
scaffolded `.moi/.gitignore` already excludes the machine-local entries (`.build/`, `.cache/`,
`node_modules/`), while `.workspace.json` and `.scratchpad.json` are workspace state that ships
with the repo — commit them as-is, just never hand-edit them. Your surface is the non-dot files:
`widgets/`, `views/`, `package.json`, and code you place under `.moi/` yourself.

# Build environment

- Bun is the required dependency of moi, so it must be installed
- For package management **always** use bun
- package.json is scaffolded during init. You are free to install/remove/do whatever with packages.
- if packages aren't installed, it's your responsibility to call `bun install`
- `react` and `react-dom` are stubs — they're provided by moi at runtime via the browser importmap.
  They're listed only so editors pick up the correct types.
- `moi bundle` runs **Bun's bundler**, so standard Bun imports, loaders, and tricks apply (JSON,
  text, etc.) — see the Bun docs. Only the moi-specific imports (covered under **Developing
  Applets**) differ.

# `moi` CLI

Treat `moi` as an external command — you cannot inspect or modify its sources. Use only the
documented subcommands (`moi bundle`, `moi bundle --force`, etc.). Call `moi help` for
documentation. Run all `moi` commands from the **project root** — the folder that contains `.moi/`,
never from inside `.moi/` itself. You don't pass paths; moi resolves the workspace from where it's run.

- `moi bundle` — compile changed applets
- `moi bundle --force` — rebuild all applets (use after changing `config`)
- `moi refresh` — re-fetch widget and view data without rebuilding (use after you mutated data the
  applets read — DB rows, files, external API records — so the displayed values catch up);
  `--only widgets` / `--only views` narrows the refresh to one kind
- `moi call-server-fn <module>/<fn> '[args]'` — invoke a `.server.ts` function directly (smoke test)
- `moi tabs` — list the workspace's tabs, their ids and the default tab
- `moi tab focus <tab-id> [--params '<json-object>']` — switch to a tab, with optional params for
  the target view (see Driving the workspace)
- `moi debug logs` — applet runtime errors on record (experimental)
- `moi theme --font=<key>` — change font theme (omit `--font` to list options)
- `moi theme --color=<key>` — change color preset (omit `--color` to list options)
- `moi theme --radius=<key>` — change corner-radius preset (omit `--radius` to list options)
- `moi config` — set the workspace name & icon (`moi config --help` for usage)
- `moi env` — list available env keys and where they come from (never values);
  `moi env exec -- <cmd>` runs a command with the workspace env (see Environment & secrets)
- `moi skill` — show installed vs bundled skill versions; `moi skill update` to refresh

For more options, commands, use `moi help`.

# Critical constraints when interacting with moi

- Never read or modify files outside the `.moi` directory, unless the user explicitly asks. If you
  do need it -> ask for permission.
- Do **not** start, stop, or inspect the Workspace web server — it is managed externally.

# Developing Applets

Every applet — a **Widget** or a **View** — is a default-exported React component in
`.moi/<type>/<name>.tsx`, optionally paired with a `<name>.server.ts`. `moi bundle` compiles each
into a live module the browser loads (edits hot-reload). Read `references/DESIGN.md` first.
Write normal React + Tailwind — below is only what's **moi-specific**.

## Anatomy

```tsx
// .moi/widgets/hello.tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { getGreeting } from './hello.server' // optional server fn — see below

// Optional config — fields are per type (see Widgets / Views below). requiredEnv is shared.
export const config = { requiredEnv: ['API_KEY'] }

export default function Hello() {
  const [msg, setMsg] = useState('')
  useEffect(() => {
    getGreeting().then(setMsg) // call server fns like any async function
  }, [])
  return <div className="h-full w-full p-4">{msg}</div>
}
```

Imports resolve relatively (same folder, or elsewhere under `.moi/` — e.g. `../lib/format`) or
from `.moi/package.json` deps — no `@/` aliases. Files starting with `_` (e.g. `_utils.tsx`) in
`widgets/` and `views/` are never applet entry points — put code shared between applets there.
`moi bundle` tracks these local imports: editing a shared module rebuilds every applet using it.

## Applet styling

- Use Tailwind for static styling. Do not add custom CSS, `@apply`, or static `style={{}}` values.
- Use `style={{}}` only for computed data such as chart geometry, progress, per-item delays, or
  per-frame transforms.
- Use icons from `@tabler/icons-react`. Do not add raw SVG icons or another icon pack. When the
  project provides `.agents/rules/icons.md`, follow its size and stroke policy.
- Applets cannot import the host project's `cn`. If `.moi/ui/utils.ts` exists, import `cn` from
  `../ui/utils`; otherwise use a local `cx()` when classes are conditional. Never build class
  names with template-literal ternaries.

```tsx
function cx(...classes: (string | false | undefined | null)[]) {
  return classes.filter(Boolean).join(' ')
}
```

## Standard UI components

Need a standard control (button, dialog, select, table, chart…)? Don't hand-roll it —
`moi ui-components add <name…>` installs moi-tuned shadcn components (Base UI + Tabler icons,
workspace theme tokens, overlays patched to keep applet styling) into `.moi/ui/`. Pass every
component you need in one call (`add table badge tabs`) instead of one `add` per component.
Import relatively: `import { Button } from '../ui/button'`.

- `moi ui-components` — the catalog with installed state. Read
  `references/UI-COMPONENTS.md` first: the full catalog plus the essential usage rules
  (Base UI composition, forms, styling, icons — condensed from the official shadcn skill).
- `moi ui-components docs <name…>` — full official docs (markdown: anatomy, props, examples) on
  demand. Read them before composing an unfamiliar component; the parts API (Base UI) differs
  from Radix-era shadcn.
- `add` never rebuilds, and installs npm packages only with `--install` (pass it unless you
  want to run the printed `bun install` yourself); run `moi bundle` yourself either way.
- Files in `.moi/ui/` are yours to customize (edits propagate to every applet using them);
  `add` skips already-installed components (reported as kept) and overwrites only with
  `--force`.
- Component names, their API, and the CLI are very close to a selected subset of shadcn, but the
  actual implementation might differ.

## Server functions — `<name>.server.ts`

Export named `async function`s (only — no `const`, sync, or class) and call them from the component
like ordinary async functions; arguments and return values are auto-serialized (`Date`, `Map`,
`Set`, … work). They run on the Bun server with `process.env` and full filesystem access, at
`cwd = <workspace root>` (the parent of `.moi/`, where you operate) — so workspace files are plain
relative paths:

```ts
// hello.server.ts — read files, call APIs, query DBs…
export async function getGreeting(): Promise<string> {
  return (await Bun.file('./notes.md').text()).split('\n')[0]
}
```

The component fetches on mount; after you change underlying data a server fn reads, run
`moi refresh` to re-pull it without a rebuild.

It's plain Bun — every Bun API is available with no setup: `bun:sqlite`, `Bun.redis`, `Bun.s3`,
`Bun.file`, `fetch`, …

## Workspace files & assets

- **Bundled asset** — `import logo from './logo.png'` resolves to a URL at build time (images &
  fonts: `png jpg gif svg webp avif ico woff woff2 ttf otf`). For small art shipped beside the
  `.tsx`.
- **Workspace file** — stream a file from the workspace via `fileUrl` from the **`moi`** package:

  ```tsx
  import { fileUrl } from 'moi'
  ;<video src={fileUrl('clips/intro.mp4')} controls />
  ```

  `fileUrl(path)` maps a **workspace-root-relative** path to a streaming URL (HTTP range — media
  seeks, nothing is base64-inlined). Media/asset extensions only; `.env`, source, JSON and dotfiles
  are rejected. The path is plain data, so a `.server.ts` can return it and the component renders
  `fileUrl(clip.file)`.

Rule of thumb: small own art → `import`; structured data → `.server.ts` returns it; large/streamable
media → `.server.ts` returns the **path**, render with `fileUrl()`.

## Driving the workspace — `focusTab` & `sendChatMessage`

An applet can move the user to another tab and talk to you, through two functions from the **`moi`**
package.

```tsx
import { focusTab, sendChatMessage } from 'moi'

// A widget row drilling into a view, and a button that asks you to do something.
focusTab('view:orders', { order: 'o-1024' })
sendChatMessage('Chase order o-1024', { order: 'o-1024', carrier: 'dhl' })
```

- `focusTab(tab, params?)` switches the workspace to a tab. Tab ids are `agent`, `widgets`,
  `scratchpad`, and `view:<id>` — run `moi tabs` for the real list. `params` arrive as the target
  view's `params` prop.
- `sendChatMessage(message, context?)` sends `message` to the active chat as if the user typed it.
  `context` is structured data you see and the user does not. Call it from event handlers, never
  during render. Context can contain additional instructions not visible to the user, describing how
  the task should be done.
- `params` and `context` accept JSON serializable values only.

### Params: the type is the contract

A view with addressable state declares a local `Params` type in its own file. Every field is
optional and carries a comment, because the view must render sensibly with `{}` — a fresh mount, a
plain tab-bar click, or a new browser tab all deliver nothing.

```tsx
// .moi/views/orders.tsx
// The view's addressable state — what `focusTab('view:orders', …)` can set.
type Params = {
  // Order id to open in the detail pane; omit to show the list.
  order?: string
}

export default function Orders({ params = {} }: { params?: Params }) {
  // Values arrive from navigation state, so narrow before trusting them.
  const openOrder = typeof params.order === 'string' ? params.order : null
  …
}
```

**Applets never import from each other, not even types.** Before wiring a `focusTab` call, read the
target view's source, mirror the shape you find there, and note where you read it. That file is the
contract; the type is documentation, not a shared module. Widgets are never navigation targets —
their `params` is always `{}`.

## Environment & secrets

Each workspace has an effective env: keys from the project's `.env` / `.env.local` (when
inheritance is enabled in settings) plus **custom secrets** the user manages in the workspace env
settings. moi injects this env into:

- applet server functions — read it as `process.env` inside `.server.ts`
- any command run via `moi env exec -- <cmd>`
- your own shell (Bash tool) — but only in some harnesses (e.g. Claude Code). Don't assume it:
  verify the key is visible first, or just use `moi env exec`, which works everywhere.

Rules:
- **Check before you assume.** When a task needs a key or token — an API pull, a widget calling a
  service — run `moi env` first. It lists key names with their source (`.env` / custom) and flags
  declared `requiredEnv` keys that are missing. Values are never shown.
- **Key present** → say which key you'll use and where it's from ("using `NOTION_TOKEN` from
  `.env`") and proceed. To run a script or one-off command with the workspace env, use
  `moi env exec -- bun script.ts` — it also picks up values changed after your session started.
- **Key missing** → never invent or hardcode a value, and don't edit `.env` yourself. Tell the user
  the exact key name to add in the workspace env settings. Still build and wire the applet: declare
  the key in `config.requiredEnv` and handle its absence, so it works the moment the user sets it.
  If the user pastes a value in chat, store it with `moi env set KEY=value`
  (`moi env unset KEY` removes it).
- **Never print secret values** — not in chat, not in logs. Refer to keys by name only.

`process.env` is readable **only** inside `.server.ts` (the `.tsx` runs in the browser) — keep API
keys there. Either source may be absent, so always handle a missing key. List expected keys in
`config.requiredEnv` — advisory only (it surfaces a hint in the UI and `moi env`; it's never
enforced).

```ts
// forecast.server.ts
export async function getForecast(city: string) {
  const key = process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY // always current — env changes respawn the worker
  if (!key) return { error: 'Add WEATHER_API_KEY to your env' }
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/forecast?city=${encodeURIComponent(city)}`, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${key}` }
  })
  if (!res.ok) return { error: `Weather API error ${res.status}` }
  return { data: await res.json() }
}
```

# Widgets

Live cards on the dashboard grid — many visible at once. `config` sets the grid footprint:

```ts
export const config = {
  colSpan: 2, // columns the card spans — 1–4
  rowSpan: 1, // rows the card spans — 1–4
  requiredEnv: ['API_KEY'] // optional env-key hints (advisory; see Environment & secrets)
} as const
```

Render **content only**: a plain `h-full w-full` region with no card chrome (`rounded-*`,
`shadow-*`, or outer `border`) — the dashboard owns the shell, spacing, and elevation. It does not
own the fill, so the widget must set its own opaque background.
Changing `colSpan`/`rowSpan` needs `moi bundle --force`. See `references/DESIGN.md`.

Typical loop: check/`bun install` deps → write the applet → `moi bundle` → run any checks.
After the final successful bundle and any checks, always make tab focus the final workspace action:

- After building or editing a widget, run `moi tab focus widgets`.
- After building or editing a view, run `moi tab focus view:<view-id>`, using its file name or claimed
  builder id.

The focused applet is the handoff. Keep the final reply brief and user-facing. Do not include file
or storage links, file paths, or bundle, test, and runtime-log summaries.

# Debugging applets

`moi bundle` only proves an applet compiles — it can still fail to load in the browser, crash on
render, or throw in its server functions. Two feedback channels exist for what happens after the
build; reach for them when they'd help (smoke-testing something new, or investigating a problem):

- `moi call-server-fn widgets/hello/getGreeting` /
  `moi call-server-fn views/crm/searchUsers '["ann", 10]'` — run one `.server.ts` function
  directly (args are one JSON array). Each invocation runs in a fresh, isolated one-shot process
  with the same env, module loading, and timeout as the browser's calls, so a pass means the real
  path works — handy for trying a function without touching the UI. Server functions only; for
  arbitrary scripts use `moi env exec`.
- `moi debug logs` — the applet errors the workspace has seen since each applet's last good
  build: browser-side load failures and render crashes, plus server-function (rpc) errors. The
  user's tab reports these automatically, so when the user says something is broken, what
  happened is usually already on record — a good first place to look. Entries clear when their
  applet next builds successfully. (`moi debug` is an experimental command group — expect its
  output and flags to evolve; use `--json` when you need to parse it.)

`moi bundle`'s footer also mentions when runtime errors are on record, so standing breakage
surfaces on its own.

# Views

Full-screen apps, one per nav tab — the user switches tabs. A view has no router of its own, but it
can be addressed: see Driving the workspace for `focusTab` and the `params` prop.

## View builder requests

When the message's hidden `<moi-context>` envelope is marked `View builder request`, this chat is
linked to a pending view tab. Before reading files, planning, or writing code, infer a short stable
id, a clear sentence-case title, and a relevant icon from the requirements. Capitalize only the
first word of the title. Your first action must claim them:

```sh
moi builder set <view-id> --builder <builder-id> --kind view --title "<title>" --icon <icon-id>
```

Choose the icon id from the available view icons in the hidden context. The id must use lowercase
letters, numbers, `_`, or `-`. The first call locks the id; running the same command again may update
its title and icon. After claiming, write `.moi/views/<view-id>.tsx`, use the same icon id in its
config, and build it with `moi bundle --only views`. The tab uses the claimed title and icon while you
work and changes into the built view after a successful bundle. (Bundling marks the view ready; the
build state is otherwise server-managed, so you never set it to done by hand.)

```ts
export const config = {
  title: 'Customer overview', // sentence-case nav label — defaults to the file name
  icon: 'user', // icon id from the view-builder request
  requiredEnv: ['CRM_API_KEY'] // optional env-key hints (advisory; see Environment & secrets)
} as const
```

The inverse of a widget: a view **owns its whole page** — its own `h-full w-full` layout, scrolling
(`overflow-auto`), padding, and chrome. Build it to read like an app screen. See `references/DESIGN.md`.

# Keeping this skill current

This skill is installed with moi (via the CLI or the UI) and can fall behind when the moi CLI updates.

- **You'll know** — `moi` commands warn you when this skill is behind.
- **To update** — run `moi skill update`. Never mid-task: finish first, or do it at the end.
- **Re-read after updating** — `moi skill update` rewrites `SKILL.md` and everything in
  `references/` on disk, so the copy already in your context is stale. Re-read this `SKILL.md`
  before you rely on it again — don't act on the old version.
- **Then** — if you updated, mention it.

<!-- moi skill version marker — read by `moi skill` to detect drift; do not edit by hand -->
<moi-skill version="0.16.0" />
