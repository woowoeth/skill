# Defuddle

Use Defuddle CLI to extract clean readable content from web pages. Prefer over WebFetch for standard web pages — it removes navigation, ads, and clutter, reducing token usage.

If not installed: `npm install -g defuddle-cli`

## Usage

Always use `--md` for markdown output:

```bash
defuddle parse <url> --md
```

Save to file:

```bash
defuddle parse <url> --md -o content.md
```

Extract specific metadata:

```bash
defuddle parse <url> -p title
defuddle parse <url> -p description
defuddle parse <url> -p domain
```

## Output formats

| Flag | Format |
|------|--------|
| `--md` | Markdown (default choice) |
| `--json` | JSON with both HTML and markdown |
| (none) | HTML |
| `-p <name>` | Specific metadata property |
| `-o <path>` | Save output to file |

## Notes

- Works with internal network addresses (192.168.x.x, localhost, etc.)
- For authenticated pages, the page must be publicly accessible from the current machine
- Save raw fetches wherever your project keeps scratch output, and keep them out of version control
