# WeChat Chat Export

Give nontechnical users a local, read-only workflow. The user chooses the account,
conversation, time range, message types, and whether attachments may be copied.
Do not ask them to find database files or run shell commands themselves.
Use Codex's bundled workspace Python runtime when available; do not ask a
nontechnical user to install Python or packages manually.

1. Run `scripts/wechat_export.py onboard --json`. If it reports
   `needs_fixed_drive_scan`, explain the bounded read-only scan in one sentence,
   obtain confirmation, and rerun with `--scan-fixed-drives`.
2. When exactly one usable active account exists, use it without asking the user
   to interpret paths. If several exist, show opaque IDs, freshness, and path hints.
   After local-path disclosure is confirmed, rerun onboarding with `--show-paths`
   and use every message database in its `database_plan`.
3. If the user already has a database key, never ask them to paste it into chat or
   place it on a command line. Use the local hidden-entry flow.
4. Prefer a verified supplied key. Use automatic key discovery only after explicit
   authorization for the exact read-only method and databases reported by the tool.
5. List conversations and preview counts before reading bodies. Resolve duplicate
   display names with opaque conversation IDs; do not expose internal usernames.
   Treat every `message_N.db` containing the selected `Msg_<md5>` table as one
   conversation: merge chronologically and deduplicate by stable message ID.
   Map ordinary-language media requests strictly: `图片` means image messages
   only; `表情` means emoticon messages only; `视频` means playable original
   video only; and `视频封面` means the video's image thumbnail only. Never add
   neighboring media kinds merely because their files share an image extension.
6. Export only the approved scope. Attachments and image-key discovery require
   separate confirmation. Remote media completion requires another explicit
   network confirmation and stays disabled otherwise. Preserve the original
   database and media files unchanged.
7. Return a clickable ZIP link and a short summary of included and excluded counts.
   For mixed or large attachment exports, prefer separate media ZIPs while keeping
   every selected media message and its attachment mapping in the records ZIP.
   Translate failures into plain language with one safe next action; keep raw
   diagnostics redacted and never make the user debug a command line.
8. Report missing, expired, or unsupported media explicitly rather than silently
   omitting it. Never report `not_found` when a targeted media directory could not
   be read completely; use `index_incomplete` and one safe next action instead.

Read [references/security-modes.md](references/security-modes.md) before any key or process operation. Read [references/export-contract.md](references/export-contract.md) when producing an export.
Read [references/discovery.md](references/discovery.md) when discovery returns multiple, stale, or no account candidates.
Read [references/compatibility.md](references/compatibility.md) before retaining a decrypted database or interpreting an unknown schema.
Read [references/selection.md](references/selection.md) when resolving a contact, time range, or message-type scope.
Read [references/media.md](references/media.md) before searching for or copying attachments.
Read [references/key-discovery.md](references/key-discovery.md) before requesting any process-memory access or handling an unknown WeChat build.
