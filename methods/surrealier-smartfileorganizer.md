# Smart File Organizer

Reads actual file contents to recover broken filenames, generate meaningful names from scratch, and optionally reorganize files into categorized folders — all with a safe rollback map.

Analyze file contents in a target directory (including all subdirectories), rename files to reflect their content, and optionally reorganize them into a logical folder structure.

## Modes

- **rename-only** (default): Rename files in place based on content analysis.
- **full-organize**: Rename files AND reorganize them into a categorized folder structure (create, rename, merge folders).
- **collect**: Scan files across directories and **copy** those matching a user-defined purpose into a single output folder. Does not rename or move originals.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Gather Parameters

Ask the user for:

1. **Target directory** — absolute path to scan (required).
2. **Mode** — `rename-only`, `full-organize`, or `collect` (default: `rename-only`).
   - If `collect`: also ask for the **collection query** — what kind of files to gather (e.g., "resume-related files", "dataset files", "disposable files").
3. **Allowed languages** — which languages to keep in file names (default: match original or English).
   ```
   Which languages should be used in file names?
     Allowed: (e.g., Korean, English)
     Others:  auto-translate to an allowed language (e.g., Japanese → English)
   ```
   - When file content is in a non-allowed language, translate the generated name into the user's preferred allowed language.
   - Acronyms and proper nouns are exempt from translation (`IITP`, `YOLOv8`, etc.).
4. **File filter** — specific extensions to include/exclude (default: all files).
5. **Max depth** — how deep to recurse into subdirectories (default: unlimited).
6. **Rename strictness** — how aggressively to rename files (default: `recovery`).
   ```
   How strictly should files be renamed?
     [R] Recovery  — only fix broken/meaningless names, keep already-descriptive names as-is
     [U] Uniform   — rename ALL files to a standardized format based on content
   ```
   - `recovery`: skip files whose current name already reasonably describes the content (even if format doesn't perfectly match the naming convention).
   - `uniform`: treat every original name as unreliable and regenerate from scratch — current behavior.

If the user provides a directory without specifying other options, use defaults and proceed.

### Step 2: Scan and Inventory

1. List all files recursively in the target directory.
2. **Skip hidden files/directories** (starting with `.`) and common ignore patterns (`node_modules`, `.git`, `__pycache__`, etc.).
3. **Skip source code files** by default — renaming breaks import paths, include directives, and build systems. Excluded extensions: `.py`, `.cpp`, `.c`, `.h`, `.hpp`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.java`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.rb`, `.cs`, `.swift`, `.kt`, `.scala`, `.sh`, `.bat`, `.ps1`, and CI/CD config files (`Jenkinsfile*`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `*.cmake`). The user can override this with an explicit `--include-code` flag or request.
4. **Skip executable/installer files** — keep `.exe`, `.msi`, `.appimage`, `.dmg` files with their original names.
5. **Detect suspected dataset directories** — identify directories that may contain bulk datasets before processing. A directory is suspected if ANY of the following is true:
   - Contains **100+ files with the same extension**.
   - Files follow sequential or hash-based naming patterns (e.g., `img_0001.jpg`…`img_9999.jpg`, `a3f8c2.png`).
   - Name matches common dataset patterns (case-insensitive): `train`, `val`, `valid`, `validation`, `test`, `dataset`, `datasets`, `images`, `labels`, `annotations`, `samples`, `corpus`, `raw`, `processed`.
   - Contains annotation/manifest files alongside bulk data (e.g., `*.json`/`*.csv` annotation + 50+ image/text files).

   For each suspected directory, **prompt the user** before deciding:
   ```
   ⚠ The following directories are suspected to be datasets:
     📁 train/       — 1,523 .jpg files, sequential naming pattern
     📁 annotations/ — 1,523 .json files + manifest.csv

   For each directory, choose:
     [S] Skip  — treat as dataset, do not rename
     [I] Include — treat as normal folder, process files
   ```
   - User-confirmed dataset directories are excluded entirely and logged as "dataset directory (user confirmed)".
   - User-confirmed non-dataset directories proceed to normal processing.
6. Create an inventory with: current path, file size, extension, last modified date.
7. **Scan directory names** — identify directories with broken or meaningless names (garbled encoding, `New Folder`, `Untitled`, numeric-only names like `1`, `2`, `3`). These are included in the rename map alongside files. Directory renames apply in all modes (including `rename-only`), and are executed **after** all file renames to avoid path invalidation.
   - **File/directory name encoding recovery** — names containing garbled bytes (mojibake) should be decoded by trying `EUC-KR`, `CP949`, `Shift_JIS`, `GB2312`, and `Latin-1` against the raw bytes. If a readable name is recovered, use it as the basis for renaming.
8. Report the inventory summary to the user:
   - Total file count
   - Breakdown by extension
   - Total size

If there are more than 100 files, ask the user to confirm before proceeding or suggest narrowing the scope with filters.

**Batch processing** — to avoid context overflow and tool-call failures:

- Maximum batch size: **50 files** per batch.
- When total files exceed 50, split the inventory into batches of up to 50.
- Process each batch as an independent sub-agent (or sequential batch if sub-agents are unavailable):
  1. Each batch receives its own file list and performs Steps 3–4 independently.
  2. Merge all batch results into a single unified rename map before presenting to the user.
- Sub-agent batches may run in parallel (up to 4 concurrent batches).
- **Sub-agent auto-approve** — sub-agents must execute all file reading and analysis operations without requiring user confirmation. Only the final consolidated dry-run map (Step 4) requires user approval. When invoking sub-agents, pass the `--auto-approve` or equivalent flag so that tool calls within each batch proceed automatically.
- Each batch must return its partial rename map as JSON for merging.
- **Batch merge deduplication** — after merging all batch results, scan for proposed name collisions:
  1. Group entries by proposed name (case-insensitive).
  2. For each collision, differentiate by appending a distinguishing attribute (date, parent folder name, or numeric suffix).
  3. Log resolved collisions in the dry-run output so the user can review.
- **Completion guardrail** — after all batches return, verify that every file in the inventory is accounted for (renamed, skipped-with-reason, or moved to `_unknown/`). If any files are missing from batch results, re-queue them in a supplementary batch. The final rename map MUST cover 100% of inventoried files.

### Step 3: Analyze File Contents

> **Behavior depends on the rename strictness setting from Step 1.**

#### When `uniform` mode:

> **⚠ CRITICAL: ALL non-code files MUST be renamed to a normalized format based on their actual content. No exceptions.**
>
> - The original file name is **unreliable** — treat it as if it were random characters.
> - You MUST read/analyze the file content first, then generate a name **from scratch**.
> - Files with partially descriptive but non-standard names (e.g., `073_disaster_safety_XR.hwpx`, `report_v2_final.docx`) MUST still be renamed after reading their content.
> - The ONLY reason to keep an original name is if it already perfectly matches the naming convention format AND accurately describes the specific content.

**Rename criteria (uniform)** — a file MUST be renamed if ANY of the following is true:

- Contains meaningless prefixes, serial numbers, or codes (`073_`, `IMG_`, `DSC_`, `001_`, `(3)`).
- Name is vague, abbreviated, or doesn't capture the document's specific subject.
- Doesn't follow the `[YYMMDD_]<attr1>_<attr2>[_...<attrN>].<ext>` format from `references/naming-conventions.md`.
- Contains non-allowed language characters (per Step 1 language settings).
- Contains generic words (`document`, `file`, `untitled`, `report`) without specific context.

#### When `recovery` mode (default):

> Only rename files with clearly broken or meaningless names. If the current name already conveys the file's content reasonably well, **keep it as-is** — even if it doesn't perfectly follow the naming convention format.

**Pre-filter (before content reading)** — to avoid reading hundreds of files unnecessarily, apply a fast name-quality heuristic FIRST:

1. Extract the file's stem (name without extension).
2. **Skip content reading** (mark as "keep") if the stem contains ≥ 2 meaningful words (not codes/numbers) and no disqualifying patterns.
3. **Require content reading** only if ANY of the following is true:
   - Stem is entirely non-alphabetic (hashes, UUIDs, numeric sequences).
   - Matches auto-generated patterns: `IMG_\d+`, `DSC\d+`, `Screen Shot`, `document\(\d+\)`, `Untitled`, `New File`.
   - Stem has fewer than 2 alphabetic tokens after stripping numbers and punctuation.
   - Contains non-allowed language characters (per Step 1).

This pre-filter dramatically reduces content reading for large directories where most files already have decent names.

**Rename criteria (recovery)** — a file is renamed ONLY if ANY of the following is true:

- Name is entirely meaningless (e.g., `IMG_20240315_142356.jpg`, `document(3).pdf`, `a3f8c2.png`).
- Name consists mostly of codes, hashes, or sequential numbers with no descriptive words.
- Name is a single generic word (`untitled`, `file`, `new`, `temp`).
- Contains non-allowed language characters (per Step 1 language settings).

Files with partially descriptive names (e.g., `quarterly_report.pdf`, `meeting_notes_march.txt`) are **kept as-is** in recovery mode.

For each file, read its content and determine a descriptive name:

#### Text-based files

Extensions: `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.html`, `.xml`, `.log`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.ini`, `.cfg`, `.conf`, `.toml`, etc.

- Read the **first 10%** of the file (by line count or byte size). Minimum: 5 lines. Maximum cap: 200 lines or **4 KB**, whichever comes first.
- Identify the main topic, purpose, or subject matter from the actual text content.
- The proposed name must reflect what the text is about, not the file format.

#### Encoding detection

If file content appears garbled or unreadable:

1. Try common encodings in order: `utf-8` → `cp949` (Korean) → `shift_jis` (Japanese) → `gb2312` (Chinese) → `euc-kr` → `latin-1`.
2. Use `file` command or `chardet`-style heuristics to detect encoding if available.
3. Once readable text is obtained, proceed with content analysis.
4. If no encoding produces readable text, mark the file as **unreadable**.

#### Documents

Extensions: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.hwp`, `.hwpx`

- Extract text from the **first 10% of pages** (minimum: 1 page, maximum: **8 KB** of extracted text).
- Read the extracted text and identify the document's subject, title, or purpose.
- **`.hwpx`** files are ZIP archives containing XML — unzip and parse `Contents/section*.xml` to extract body text.
- **`.hwp`** files — use `hwp5txt` or `pyhwp` if available; otherwise try `strings` command with Korean encoding.
- If text extraction fails, use metadata (title, author, subject) as fallback.
- Only fall back to the existing name as a last resort, and flag it for user review with `⚠ content unreadable — name based on metadata/original`.

#### Images

Extensions: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `.jfif`

- Check EXIF data or embedded metadata if available.
- If the agent has vision capability, **analyze the image content directly** and name based on what is depicted.
- Otherwise, attempt **contextual inference** in this order:
  1. **Sibling files** — check other files in the same directory for topic/project clues.
  2. **Timestamps** — compare creation/modification time with nearby files to find temporal clusters.
  3. **File name fragments** — extract any meaningful parts from the original name (dates, sequence numbers, app names).
  4. **Parent directory name** — use the folder name as a category hint.
- If none of the above yields a confident name, move to `_unknown/`.

#### Binary / unknown files

- Use file metadata and extension only.
- Do not attempt to read binary content.

#### Unreadable files

Files that cannot be analyzed (corrupted, encrypted, unsupported format, all encoding attempts failed):

- Move to `<target-dir>/_unknown/` preserving the original file name.
- Log the reason for failure (e.g., "encoding detection failed", "binary with no metadata").
- Include these in the dry-run preview so the user can override the decision.

#### Language handling

Apply the allowed languages setting from Step 1:

- Detect the language of the file content.
- If the content language is not in the allowed list, translate the proposed name into the user's preferred allowed language.
- Keep acronyms and proper nouns untranslated.

#### Naming rules

Refer to `references/naming-conventions.md` for detailed patterns. Key rules:

- Use `_` separator between attributes, `-` within multi-word attributes.
- Keep names concise: 3–6 attributes maximum.
- Preserve the original file extension.
- Include a date prefix (`YYMMDD_`) when the file has a clear associated date.
- Avoid generic names like `document`, `file`, `untitled`.
- **Always generate a fresh name from content analysis** — never copy the original file name. Even if the original name contains relevant words, rebuild the name from scratch following the naming convention format.

### Step 4: Generate Rename Map (Dry Run)

Build a rename map as JSON. **When total files exceed 30, use summary-first presentation:**

```
📊 Rename Summary
  Rename:  142 files
  Keep:    358 files (name already descriptive)
  Unknown:   5 files → _unknown/

  By extension: .pdf (42) · .hwpx (31) · .jpg (28) · .docx (22) · .txt (19)

  [Show full list]  [Show by folder]  [Show renames only]
```

When the user requests details (or total files ≤ 30), show the full rename map:

```
Current Name                    → Proposed Name
────────────────────────────────────────────────
IMG_20240315_142356.jpg         → 240315_sunset_beach-photo.jpg
document(3).pdf                 → 240901_quarterly_sales-report_Q3.pdf
073_disaster_safety_XR.hwpx     → 250530_IITP_disaster-safety_XR-augmentation_proposal.hwpx
notes.txt                       → meeting-notes_product-roadmap.txt

⚠ Unreadable (→ _unknown/):
corrupted-data.bin              → _unknown/corrupted-data.bin (reason: binary, no metadata)
```

**Iterative approval loop** — repeat until the user explicitly approves:

1. Present the full rename map.
2. The user may:
   - **Approve all** — proceed to Step 5.
   - **Request changes** — e.g., "use Korean names", "make names shorter", "keep the date prefix on photos only", "don't move file X to _unknown".
   - **Edit specific entries** — modify individual proposed names.
   - **Exclude files** — skip certain files.
   - **Cancel** — abort the operation.
3. If the user requests changes, revise the affected entries and present the updated map again.
4. Go back to step 1 of this loop.

Do NOT proceed to execution until the user gives explicit approval.

**Pre-execution rollback map** — immediately after the user approves, save the planned rollback map BEFORE any file operations:

```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/rename-map.sh save <target-dir>
```

This creates `<target-dir>/.file-organizer-map.json` so that even if execution is interrupted mid-way, the user can still rollback completed operations.

### Step 5: Execute Renames

After the rollback map is saved:

1. Rename files one by one.
2. **Progress reporting** — for large batches (50+ files), report progress every 25 files:
   ```
   ✅ 25/142 renamed... (17%)
   ✅ 50/142 renamed... (35%)
   ```
3. Report any errors (e.g., name conflicts, permission issues).
4. On name conflict, append a numeric suffix: `report_Q3_2.pdf`.
5. **Reconcile the rollback map** — after all renames complete, verify the map against actual filesystem state and remove entries for operations that did not execute:
   ```bash
   bash <skill-path>/scripts/rename-map.sh reconcile <target-dir>
   ```
   This ensures the rollback map only contains operations that actually happened.
6. **Execution completeness check** — compare the reconciled map + skip list against the original inventory. If any files were neither renamed nor explicitly skipped, report them as errors and retry.

### Step 6: Reorganize (full-organize mode only)

If the user chose `full-organize`, after renaming:

1. Analyze existing folder structure and file content categories.
2. Propose a new folder structure — this may include:
   - **Creating new folders** for categories that don't exist yet.
   - **Renaming existing folders** to more descriptive names (e.g., `misc/` → `reports/`, `New Folder/` → `presentations/`).
   - **Merging folders** that contain similar content.
   - **Removing empty folders** after files are moved out.

   Example proposal:
   ```
   📁 Folder changes:
     [NEW]    documents/reports/
     [NEW]    images/screenshots/
     [RENAME] misc/ → data/csv/
     [RENAME] New Folder/ → presentations/
     [DELETE] old-stuff/ (empty after move)

   📁 Proposed structure:
   <target-dir>/
   ├── documents/
   │   ├── reports/
   │   └── notes/
   ├── images/
   │   ├── photos/
   │   └── screenshots/
   ├── data/
   │   ├── csv/
   │   └── json/
   └── other/
   ```

3. Folder naming follows the same conventions as file naming (see `references/naming-conventions.md`), using descriptive names.
4. Present the proposed folder changes AND file moves to the user for approval.
5. After approval, execute folder operations first (create/rename), then move files, then clean up empty directories.
6. All folder rename/move operations are recorded in the rollback map for undo.

### Step 6b: Collect (collect mode only)

If the user chose `collect`, **skip Steps 3–6** and follow this procedure instead:

1. Use the **collection query** from Step 1 to define the search criteria.
2. For each file in the inventory, determine relevance by:
   - File name and path keywords.
   - Content sampling (first 4 KB for text, 8 KB for documents) — same caps as Step 3.
   - Metadata (extension, parent folder name, dates).
3. Score each file's relevance and build a **collect list** with confidence levels:
   ```
   📋 Collect: "resume-related files" → _collected/resume_related/
     ✅ High (12 files):
       documents/resume_john-doe.pdf
       career/portfolio_2025.pptx
       ...
     🔶 Medium (5 files):
       misc/cover-letter_draft.docx
       ...
     ❌ Excluded (283 files): not relevant
   ```
4. Present the collect list and ask user to approve, adjust threshold, or exclude specific files.
5. After approval, **copy** (not move) matched files to `<target-dir>/_collected/<query-slug>/`.
6. Preserve original directory structure as flat copies (prepend parent folder name on conflict).
7. Log the collection in `.file-organizer-changelog.md`.

### Step 7: Summary Report

Output a summary:

- Files renamed: count
- Files moved: count (if full-organize)
- Files collected: count and destination (if collect)
- Files skipped: count and reasons
- Rollback command: `bash <skill-path>/scripts/rename-map.sh rollback <target-dir>`

**Save change log** — write a Markdown file at `<target-dir>/.file-organizer-changelog.md` with:

```markdown
# File Organizer Change Log

- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
- **Mode**: rename-only | full-organize | collect
- **Target**: <target-dir>

## Changes (N files)

| # | Before | After |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | `old-name.pdf` | `new-name.pdf` |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Skipped (M files)

| # | File | Reason |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `some-file.py` | Source code (excluded) |
| 2 | `train/` (1523 files) | Dataset directory (user confirmed) |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Moved to _unknown/ (K files)

| # | File | Reason |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `hash-image.webp` | Unreadable content |
| ... | ... | ... |
```

This file is overwritten on each run (previous logs are not preserved).

## Rollback

The rollback map (`.file-organizer-map.json`) records every rename/move operation for undo purposes. The user can manage it with these commands:

```bash
# Save current rename map (done automatically before execution)
bash <skill-path>/scripts/rename-map.sh save <target-dir>

# Show the current rollback map contents
bash <skill-path>/scripts/rename-map.sh show <target-dir>

# Undo all renames/moves recorded in the map
bash <skill-path>/scripts/rename-map.sh rollback <target-dir>

# Reconcile map after execution (remove entries for operations that didn't happen)
bash <skill-path>/scripts/rename-map.sh reconcile <target-dir>

# Clear the rollback map (after confirming changes are correct)
bash <skill-path>/scripts/rename-map.sh clear <target-dir>
```

The user can also ask the agent directly: "rollback the last file organization", "show me what was renamed", or "clear the rollback history".

## Safety Rules

- NEVER overwrite existing files — always check for conflicts first.
- NEVER execute `rm -rf` or any recursive delete command without explicit user approval — even inside sub-agents. Deletions of empty directories (`rmdir`) are allowed only after confirming the directory is empty.
- ALWAYS save the rollback map before making any changes.
- ALWAYS show the dry-run preview and get explicit user approval before executing.
- Skip files that are currently open or locked.
- Preserve file permissions and timestamps when renaming/moving.
