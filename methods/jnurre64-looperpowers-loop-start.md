name: loop-start
description: Use when the user asks to start, restart or resume the orchestrator loop ("resume the loop", "start the loop", "kick the loop off again") in a project that has claude-work/loop.json, or when a session is picking up a paused loop.

# loop-start

Normal use: `$loop-start` in Codex or `/loop-start` in Claude. Start the runtime saved by
setup; do not make the user choose from a mode menu on every start. Optional `--once` runs
one iteration and stops. Existing `--mode` overrides and `--force` remain advanced options.

Preflight, then start the loop with the project's own command. **A failed preflight stops
before `/loop` with the exact fix; there is no partial start.**

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** the project's `docs/LOOP.md` (path from `loop.json`) defines what
an iteration does and when it stops. This skill routes the shared workflow to the actual client runtime.

Read [the shared runtime contract](references/runtime.md) first. It defines client/mode
selection, scheduler preflight, verbatim command selection and recovery. Resolve helpers
from this installed skill folder, following symlinks.

## 1. Load the project data

```bash
cat claude-work/loop.json            # missing → stop: "run /loop-setup first"
```
Then read `status_file`. Both are required; nothing is inferred.

Resolve the actual client's saved choice using
`python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/preflight.py --client <client> --resolve-mode`.
Pass `--once` or `--mode <mode>` only when the user requested that override. The resolver
reads `default_modes` from loop.json; legacy Claude projects retain persistent behavior,
while Codex defaults to native Goal. Both still need their project block. Missing capabilities never change the
selected mode. A saved setup choice is explicit authorization to select that runtime on
later starts, not evidence that its scheduler is available. Briefly state whether this start
continues automatically or runs just once; do not ask the user to reselect it.

When the resolved mode is `goal`, read [the native Goal guide](references/codex-goal.md)
and follow its start/resume procedure **instead of all remaining sections below**. The
scheduler report, clean-main, STOPPED-header and publication checks below apply to legacy
scheduled/bounded workflows, not interactive Goal.

When the resolved mode is `supervised`, read [the Codex supervisor guide](references/codex-supervisor.md).
Use its run/inspect/stop workflow instead of steps 2–4 below: the executable performs its own
preflight, acquisition and lifecycle notifications. Do not pre-acquire an owner or wrap its
iteration in another loop. Review project timer policy and fresh external-runtime/worker
reconciliation first; then launch via the user's selected host process manager. A chat's
background process is not verified durable hosting. Never install/start a service merely
because this skill was installed.

## 2. Preflight — every line is a hard stop with its fix

| check | command | on failure |
|---|---|---|
| On `default_branch` | `git branch --show-current` | stop: "checkout `<branch>`" |
| Clean tree | `git status --porcelain` is empty except `claude-work/.loop-owner` | stop: "commit or remove: `<files>`" — an untracked file is NOT "nothing actionable"; the loop commits `status_file` straight to the branch and a stray file will ride along or get lost |
| Up to date | `git fetch` then `git status -sb` shows neither ahead nor behind | behind → `git pull --ff-only`; ahead/diverged → stop |
| Identity | `gh api user -q .login` equals `bot_user` | stop: "gh is `<login>`, loop expects `<bot_user>`" |
| Notify path | `notify` file exists and is executable | stop: "notify script missing" (unset `notify` → note "no notify; posts go to the user only" and continue) |
| Runtime | Verify the selected client/mode capabilities and reconcile scheduler/dispatch state per the runtime contract | missing or unknown → stop before ownership or notification; bounded mode requires explicit selection |
| Start block | Select the client/mode heading per the runtime contract; validate its complete fenced block and all project gates | stop: "no start block; run /loop-setup" |
| STATUS shape | `status_file` header line contains `STOPPED` | not STOPPED → pause/reconcile first; PAUSED is legacy, not proof of an active worker. Never fix only the header |
| Single owner | Inspect owner AND scheduler state | existing/legacy/unknown state → stop; `--force` requires verified prior-runtime shutdown and reconciliation before token-checked release and atomic acquisition |

After read-only capability inspection, write a temporary JSON report outside the checkout
using the schema in the runtime contract. Run
`python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/preflight.py --client <client> --mode <mode> --report <temp-report>`.
It validates the snapshot and emits the selected block verbatim. Preserve that output without
shell command substitution (which strips trailing newlines). This supplements every check
above; it does not perform identity checks or certify an adapter from its own declarations.

## 3. Situation

Read `status_file` and show the user one paragraph: the header line, what is in flight, what
is next ready, what a human is awaited for. This is the resume point; the loop's first
iteration acts on it.

## 4. Start

1. After every preflight passes, acquire ownership with
   `python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/owner.py acquire --client <client> --mode <mode> --session <id> --runtime <runtime>`.
   Keep its token; never git add the owner. Acquisition failure stops the start.
2. Post through `notify`: `▶️ <project> loop resumed · <mode> · <one-line situation>`.
   If it fails, do not schedule or dispatch. Follow verified shutdown and token-checked
   release in the runtime contract; report the failure locally.
3. Invoke the selected project block **verbatim** through the verified runtime. Legacy
   blocks invoke Claude's `loop` skill only. A changed command requires a project doc edit
   and commit, never a start-time rewrite. Record owned task handles and validate the token
   before every iteration or external mutation.
4. Bounded mode performs one iteration, then follows `loop-pause` to publish the dashboard,
   notify and release ownership. Say explicitly that no future wakeup is armed. Any partial
   start failure requires stop/inspect; retain ownership if shutdown is uncertain.

## Rationalisations that mean STOP

| thought | reality |
|---|---|
| "the untracked file is just a note, nothing actionable" | It is a dirty tree. Clean it or stop. |
| "the owner file is probably stale, the timestamps prove it" | `--force` still requires verified shutdown of the old runtime. Say what the file says and stop. |
| "I'll tweak the /loop text slightly for today" | The block is verbatim. Change the doc, commit, then start. |
| "notify is down but the loop can run" | Stops that cannot post are the known failure. Fix notify first. |
