name: phraser-expand
description: Use when a user's prompt is vague or under-specified — a generic verb with no clear target (fix, improve, handle, clean up, make better), no file/module/scope named, or no definition of what "done" looks like. Sharpens the prompt into either a short round of clarifying questions or a structured, task-shaped SHARPENED PROMPT block (goal, done-when, and assumptions always present, the rest adapted to the task) requiring explicit approval before any work begins. Triggered by the local heuristic gate (scripts/gate.js) flagging a prompt "vague", or by the user invoking /phraser:gist directly.

# phraser-expand

Turn a vague prompt into either a short, targeted question or a precise
instruction — never both, never a form to fill out. This skill inherits
whatever model is already running the session; it does not pin its own.

## Procedure

Do these in order. Do not skip step 1.

1. **Restate the goal in one line.** Before deciding anything else, write
   one sentence for yourself: "The user wants to ___." If you can't fill
   that in with any confidence, the prompt needs a question, not an
   expansion — say so in the restatement and move to step 3 knowing scope
   is the open question.

2. **Gather context already available before judging anything unclear.**
   Check, in this order, and use whatever you find:
   - `CLAUDE.md` (or nested `CLAUDE.md` files) — project conventions,
     architecture, and stated preferences.
   - Recently touched files in the session — a bare pronoun ("this",
     "it") often resolves to whatever was just open or just edited.
   - The current `git diff` / recent commits — signals what's actively
     in flight and what the prompt likely refers to.

   Never ask about something this context already answers. If context
   resolves the *entire* ambiguity, skip straight to the expansion (step 5)
   and cite what you used instead of asking.

3. **Decide what's actually unclear, after context-gathering:**
   - **Scope is unclear** — no file, module, or area named or resolvable
     from context → candidate for a question.
   - **"Done" is undefined** — no acceptance criteria, no test
     expectation, no observable success condition, and none is inferable
     from context → candidate for a question.
   - **It's a stylistic or structural call** (naming, formatting,
     internal code structure, which of several reasonable approaches) that
     you can reasonably default on → **do not ask.** State the assumption
     in the expansion instead and proceed.

4. **Cap questions at 3.** If more than 3 things are genuinely unclear
   after steps 2–3, ask only the 3 most blocking ones (the ones where a
   wrong guess would waste the most work) and state assumptions for the
   rest in the expansion that follows the user's answer.

5. **One clarify round, then proceed.** This is not multi-turn
   coaching. After the user answers (or if you've already asked once this
   task), move to the expansion — filling remaining gaps with stated
   assumptions rather than asking again.

## Output shape A — clarifying questions

Used when scope or done-ness is genuinely unclear even after gathering
context. At most 3 questions, each one closing a real gap — not a
checklist.

### How to ask: route the answer back into this flow

**This section is only about *how* to ask once step 3 has already
established that a question is genuinely needed. It is not a reason to
ask.** The default is still shape B. In particular:

- If the user named a file, a value, or a target, that settles scope.
  Anything about *neighbouring* files or wider blast radius is an
  assumption to state in shape B — not a question. "Bump the version in
  `package.json` to 0.2.0" is finished as written; that other files
  carry the same string is a line in **Assumptions stated**, not a
  question about which files to touch.
- Consequences you can see and the user hasn't ruled on (a test that will
  need re-baselining, a lockfile that drifts) go in **Constraints** or
  **Assumptions stated**, flagged for correction. Only ask when getting
  it wrong would waste real work *and* you cannot pick a defensible
  default.

Two ways to ask, in order of preference:

1. **Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool** when the open points are
   choice-shaped — that is, when you can offer genuinely distinct, plausible
   options rather than inventing filler. The user's selection returns inside
   this same turn, so you continue straight to shape B without the answer
   ever looking like a fresh message. Fits this skill's limits naturally:
   at most 3 questions, 2–4 options each, and the automatic "Other" choice
   carries free-text when none of the options fit.

2. **Fall back to the block below** when either the tool is unavailable (it
   does not exist in headless / `--print` sessions) **or** at least one
   question is genuinely open-ended, where options would be invented filler
   — "paste the error you're seeing" has no good multiple choice. Prefer
   one coherent interaction: if any question needs prose, ask them all in
   prose rather than splitting across both mechanisms.

   Two parts of this are non-negotiable; how you draw the block around them
   is not:

   - A line containing exactly the words **"PHRASER — CLARIFYING
     QUESTIONS"**, so it's unmistakable at a glance which skill is asking.
   - A closing line, always present, always the *last* thing you output —
     telling the user their next reply is read as the answer to these
     questions specifically. Not implied, not skippable because it seems
     obvious: literally write a sentence like "Reply with your answers and
     I'll turn them into a sharpened prompt." This line is the actual fix
     for the ambiguity this section exists to solve — dropping it defeats
     the point even if everything else is present.

   Decorate it however reads best — code fence, box-drawing rule, markdown
   heading, whatever renders cleanly for the surface you're on:

   ```
   ─── PHRASER — CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ───
   <the questions>
   ──────────────────────────────────────
   Reply with your answers and I'll turn them into a sharpened prompt.
   ```

   **Nothing precedes this block. No exceptions.** Never write a sentence
   explaining that you're falling back to it, that a tool wasn't available,
   or why you chose this form — a user reading it should have no idea two
   mechanisms exist. If you notice yourself about to write a sentence
   containing the word "AskUserQuestion" or the word "available", delete it
   and start the block instead. Restatement and context notes (step 1, step
   2) are fine before the block; commentary about *how you're asking* is
   never fine, in either mechanism.

Either way, ask once. Do not chain a second round (procedure step 5).

> **Prompt:** `add auth`
>
> You want to add authentication to the project. Three things change how
> this gets built:
>
> 1. Session-based, JWT, or an existing provider (Auth0, Clerk, etc.)?
> 2. Which routes or pages need to be protected — all of them, or specific
>    ones?
> 3. Is there an existing user model/database to hook into, or does this
>    start from scratch?

All three are choice-shaped, so this one is a good `AskUserQuestion` call
— options like "session-based / JWT / existing provider" are real
alternatives, not filler.

If a `CLAUDE.md` in that same repo already stated "session-based auth via
Passport.js; user model at `src/db/models/user.js`," questions 1 and 3
are already answered — don't ask them. Only question 2 would remain,
so this becomes a single targeted question, not three.

## Output shape B — the sharpened prompt

The end product, reached either directly (nothing needed asking) or after
one round of shape A.

Set it apart from ordinary conversation with the delimiters below — this
block is the deliverable, and it should be obvious at a glance where it
starts and ends, and copy-pasteable on its own. Then ask for approval and
**stop**.

Goal / Done when / Assumptions stated are always present. The middle
sections adapt to what the task actually is — **Constraints** and **Files
in scope** fit an edit to existing code; a from-scratch build reads better
as **Deliverable** / **Functionality** / **UI** / **Out of scope**, or
whatever the task's own natural shape is. Pick names a reader would
recognize as covering the same ground (what's being built and how, what's
explicitly excluded), not a rigid template forced onto every prompt.

```
═══ SHARPENED PROMPT ═══════════════════

**Goal:** …
<task-shaped middle sections>
**Done when:** …
**Assumptions stated:** …

════════════════════════════════════════
Approved? Reply yes to go ahead, or tell me what to change.
```

The approval line is deliberately plain prose, not `AskUserQuestion`:
answering through a tool would leave you mid-turn holding an "approved",
and the natural next move from there is to start building — which is
exactly what this skill must not do. A prose question ends the turn, so
the work only begins when the user actually sends the next message.

> **Prompt:** `clean up the styling in this component`
> **Context used:** git diff shows `src/components/Card.jsx` as the only
> file with uncommitted changes this session — resolves "this component".
>
> ═══ SHARPENED PROMPT ═══════════════════
>
> **Goal:** Clean up the styling in `src/components/Card.jsx`.

> stylesheet, if one exists.
> **Done when:** No functional or visual regressions; class names and
> structure match the convention used by sibling components in

> **Assumptions stated:** "Clean up" read as consolidating duplicated
> class names and removing dead styles, not a visual redesign — a
> structural call within reasonable discretion (step 3), not something
> worth a question.

## What this skill does not do

- It does not re-run the heuristic gate — by the time this skill is
  loaded, something has already decided the prompt is worth a closer
  look (the gate, or a direct `/phraser:gist` invocation).
- It does not chain further clarify rounds. One round, then proceed.
- It does not invent scope the user didn't imply. An assumption stated
  in the expansion should be the smallest reasonable reading of the
  prompt, not the most ambitious one.
- **It does not carry out the sharpened prompt.** The job ends at the
  SHARPENED PROMPT block and the approval question — no edits, no
  commands, no "and I've gone ahead and started". Even when the work is
  obvious and small, stop there and let the user approve first.
