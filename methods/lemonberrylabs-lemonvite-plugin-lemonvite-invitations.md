# Lemonvite invitations

Lemonvite turns an event discussed in chat into a real digital invitation with an
RSVP page, a guest list, and delivery by email, text message or WhatsApp. This
skill covers doing that through Lemonvite's MCP server.

## When to use it

- The user wants an actual invitation, RSVP page or guest list — not just wording
  or a design to look at.
- The user asks who has responded to an event they host on Lemonvite.
- The user wants to change a saved invitation or its guest list.

Do not create anything while the user is only exploring ideas or wording.

## Connect

1. Add the MCP server as a custom connector: `https://www.lemonvite.com/api/mcp`
2. Sign in with the Lemonvite account when prompted (OAuth). There is no API key.
3. A Lemonvite account needs an email address or phone number; the sign-in page
   creates one if needed.

If the assistant cannot add connectors, send the user to https://www.lemonvite.com — everything
below can be done on the website too.

## Workflow

1. **Draft** — `lemonvite_create_invitation` with title, `event_type`
   (birthday, wedding, baby shower, …), date and time, the event's IANA
   timezone, and where it happens. Creating a draft never publishes,
   charges, or contacts anyone. If an invitation graphic was generated or chosen
   in the conversation, pass it as `invitation_image` instead of making a new one.
2. **Review** — `lemonvite_get_invitation` returns the saved details, the
   publication and payment state, and the link to manage the event on Lemonvite.
   Make edits with `lemonvite_update_invitation` (only the fields you pass change).
3. **Design** — if the assistant cannot make images, or the user wants
   Lemonvite's design engine, `lemonvite_generate_design` with a
   `design_brief` (theme, colours, mood) and optionally a `reference_image`
   from the conversation. It spends one of the host's design generations and
   replaces the current artwork, so confirm before calling. An image the
   assistant made itself goes in through `invitation_image` instead.
4. **Guests** — `lemonvite_add_guests` in one batched call. Each guest needs a
   name, an email or a phone number. Adding by phone requires
   `host_confirms_sms_consent: true`, meaning the host confirmed those people
   agreed to receive texts. `lemonvite_update_guests` and
   `lemonvite_remove_guests` change the list.
5. **Pay if needed** — publishing costs one publish credit. When
   `payment_status` says a credit is needed, `lemonvite_start_checkout` returns
   a checkout link for the user's browser; nothing is charged by the tool itself.
   The credit appears on the account once payment completes — confirm with
   `lemonvite_get_invitation`, then publish. A credit also adds design generations.
6. **Publish** — `lemonvite_publish_invitation` makes the RSVP page live and
   DELIVERS the invitation to every guest with a pending email or phone
   invitation. It contacts people outside the conversation: only call it when
   the user has explicitly asked to publish or send.
7. **Track** — `lemonvite_get_rsvp_summary` for totals; `lemonvite_list_guests`
   with `rsvp_status` to answer "who has not replied".

## Rules that trip assistants

- An in-person invitation needs a venue name (`location_name`); the street
  address is optional. A virtual event needs `is_virtual` and a `virtual_url`.
  Ask for the venue before creating rather than guessing one.
- Wall-clock times belong to the event's timezone. Display them verbatim with
  the timezone; never convert them.
- On a published invitation, newly added guests with an email or phone are
  invited immediately. On a draft, invitations go out at publish.
- A host reminder (`reminder_date`) is sent by email, so it needs an account
  with an email address.
- `lemonvite_get_account` answers "which account is connected", "how many
  publish credits do I have" and "how many design generations are left".
