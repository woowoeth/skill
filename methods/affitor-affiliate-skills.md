# affiliate-check: Live Affiliate Program Data

Query affiliate program data from openaffiliate.dev in real-time. Persistent daemon
with in-memory cache — first call auto-starts the server, every subsequent call is instant.

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any affiliate-check command)

Before using any command, find the skill and check if the binary exists:

```bash
# Check project-level first, then user-level
if test -x .claude/skills/affiliate-skills/tools/dist/affiliate-check; then
  A=.claude/skills/affiliate-skills/tools/dist/affiliate-check
elif test -x ~/.claude/skills/affiliate-skills/tools/dist/affiliate-check; then
  A=~/.claude/skills/affiliate-skills/tools/dist/affiliate-check
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

Set `A` to whichever path exists and use it for all commands.

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "affiliate-check needs a one-time build (~10 seconds). OK to proceed?"
2. If approved, run: `cd <SKILL_DIR> && ./setup`
3. If `bun` is not installed: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

- State file: `/tmp/affiliate-check.json`
- Auto-shutdown after 30 min idle
- Server crash → auto-restarts on next command
