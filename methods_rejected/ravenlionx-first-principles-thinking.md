description: This skill should be used when the user wants to analyze a complex problem from the ground up, break down inherited assumptions, reconstruct a solution from fundamental truths, or apply first-principles reasoning.

# First Principles Thinking

## Overview

Guide the user through a structured first-principles analysis to deconstruct complex problems down to irreducible truths, distinguish real constraints from historical inertia, and reconstruct novel solutions from the ground up. This skill treats first-principles thinking not as a philosophy slogan but as an executable, repeatable workflow.

## When to Use This Skill

- The user asks "为什么一定要..." or challenges an established norm.
- The user wants to redesign a system, process, or product from scratch.
- The user faces a problem where conventional solutions feel expensive, slow, or stale.
- The user needs to identify which constraints are physical/legal/economic necessities and which are organizational habits.
- The user wants to generate breakthrough ideas rather than incremental improvements.

## Workflow Decision Tree

Before starting the full workflow, determine if first-principles thinking is appropriate:

**Yes, proceed** if:
- The problem is novel, complex, or poorly served by existing solutions.
- The user suspects inherited assumptions are hiding better alternatives.
- The stakes are high enough to justify the cognitive cost of deep decomposition.

**No, use analogy or best-practice instead** if:
- The problem is routine and well-solved by industry standards (e.g., choosing a toothpaste brand).
- Speed matters more than optimality.
- The user lacks domain depth to verify atomic facts.

## Phase 1: Surface and Challenge Assumptions

**Goal:** Make all hidden defaults explicit.

1. Ask the user to state the problem or goal in one sentence.
2. List every implicit assumption surrounding that problem. Include:
   - Industry conventions ("this is how it's always done")
   - Organizational habits ("our process requires 3 approvals")
   - Market pricing ("batteries cost $600/kWh")
   - Structural defaults ("a rocket must be single-use")
   - Cognitive shortcuts ("users won't accept change")
3. For each assumption, tag it as either:
   - **T = Testable**: Can be empirically verified or falsified.
   - **U = Untested**: Inherited from tradition, analogy, or authority.
4. Flag all **U** assumptions as candidates for decomposition.

> **Tip:** Use the prompt: *"If you had to explain this process to someone from 500 years ago, which steps would sound absurd?"*

## Phase 2: Decompose to Atomic Facts

**Goal:** Break the problem into irreducible truths across six constraint dimensions.

For each flagged assumption, decompose until reaching facts that cannot be disputed without denying physics, math, or law.

| Dimension | What to Ask | Example (Rocket Cost) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Physical** | What are the material, energy, spatial, or temporal limits? | Aluminum + titanium + fuel + manufacturing labor |
| **Economic** | What are the real unit, marginal, and fixed costs? | Raw materials ~2% of market price; rest is labor, markup, risk premium |
| **Informational** | What data exists, what is its latency/noise, who can access it? | Telemetry, supply chain quotes, test data |
| **Human** | What will people actually do, understand, and tolerate? | Engineers can build in-house if given budget and mandate |
| **Organizational** | What are the real incentive structures and responsibility boundaries? | Cost-plus contracts discourage cost reduction |
| **Regulatory / Safety** | What is legally or safety-wise non-negotiable? | FAA launch licenses, structural safety margins |

**Stop rule:** Stop decomposing when a statement can be verified by measurement, physical law, or binding regulation. If still debatable, decompose further.

## Phase 3: Separate Facts from Inertia

**Goal:** Distinguish immovable constraints from movable history.

Create a two-column table:

| **Immutable Facts** (must design around) | **Movable Inertia** (can be challenged) |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Physical laws, material properties | "We have always used vendor X" |
| Legal requirements | "Our org chart has 8 departments" |
| Hard cost floors | "The budget cycle is annual" |
| Genuine user disabilities/limits | "Users need 20 form fields" |

**Decision rule:**
- If removing the item violates physics, law, or math → **Immutable**.
- If removing the item merely causes organizational discomfort → **Inertia**.

## Phase 4: Reconstruct from Fundamentals

**Goal:** Build a new solution architecture using only immutable facts as scaffolding.

1. State the system's **non-negotiable objective** in measurable terms (cost, speed, accuracy, throughput, reliability).
2. Ignore all legacy structures. Ask: *"If we started today with no existing code, contracts, or teams, what is the minimum viable system that satisfies the objective given only the immutable facts?"*
3. Design around flows, not organs:
   - **Material flow:** What physical objects move, and where?
   - **Capital flow:** Where does money enter, sit, and exit?
   - **Information flow:** What signals must travel, to whom, by when?
   - **Responsibility flow:** Who decides, who confirms, who is liable?
   - **Risk flow:** Where can it fail, how is it detected, who recovers it?
4. For each module, ask:
   - Must this be built in-house?
   - Can this be purchased?
   - Does this need to exist at all?

## Phase 5: Validate with Experiments

**Goal:** Turn reconstructed hypotheses into tested knowledge.

For each critical design choice, define:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hypothesis** | The specific claim being tested (e.g., "Users can complete onboarding in 30 seconds with 3 fields") |
| **Minimum Experiment** | The cheapest, fastest way to generate disconfirming evidence |
| **Failure Signal** | What observation would prove the hypothesis wrong? |
| **Pivot Action** | What to do if the signal appears? |
| **Success Threshold** | What metric must be met to accept the hypothesis? |

Run experiments in order of **cheapest failure first**. Do not build the full system before testing the riskiest assumption.

## Core Question Template

Use these eight questions as a rapid diagnostic. Answer each in writing before committing to a solution.

1. What is the **ultimate problem** we are actually solving?
2. Which constraints are **physically, legally, or mathematically unchangeable**?
3. Which constraints are **merely habits, history, or organizational scar tissue**?
4. If we started from zero today, **what would we build**?
5. What is the **smallest closed loop** that delivers value?
6. Where do the **largest costs, delays, and risks** originate?
7. Which modules **must be custom**, which can be **bought**, and which are **unnecessary**?
8. What is the **fastest experiment** to prove or disprove this design?

## Common Traps

- **Mistaking opinion for fact:** "Users won't like it" is not a fact until tested.
- **Decomposing forever:** Stop when components are verifiable; do not atomize into philosophy.
- **Ignoring reassembly:** Deconstruction without reconstruction is just criticism.
- **Neglecting execution cost:** A perfect first-principles design that takes 10 years to build may still be wrong.
- **Rejecting all analogy:** Some conventions exist because they are genuinely optimal; only challenge what fails the fact/inertia test.
