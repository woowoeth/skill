name: remotion-ffmpeg-video
description: >-
  Make and verify a first programmatic video with Remotion and FFmpeg, and check the
  file, not the exit code. Use when someone wants a video made for their business or
  product ("make a 30 second video for my diwali boxes", "ek chhota video banao", "a
  reel", "a short", "an ad from my photos"), wants a video trimmed, joined, converted or
  fixed, or wants a render checked. Starts with a preflight that gets a fresh machine
  ready (FFmpeg, Node, Python, a Remotion project), reads BUSINESS-TRUTH.md for the
  facts, uses a beginner default contract (1080 by 1920, 30 fps, H.264, local review
  only) as labelled assumptions, asks at most three questions, tells before installing
  or writing into an existing project, verifies the produced file with a full decode,
  and ends with the noguess check. Not for story or creative direction alone. Never
  uploads, publishes, schedules or spends money.

# Remotion + FFmpeg Video

## Outcome

A video file the person can play, built so it can be rebuilt: the inputs, the timeline, the
render settings and the verification are all written down. A render is a local file. It is
not permission to upload, publish, schedule, replace anything, or spend money. Answer in the
language the person wrote in. No em-dashes in text you write.

## When to stand down

A small, reversible edit the person wants now (trim two seconds, swap a title, convert a
file): still run check 1 below (is FFmpeg there), then do it, verify the output with one
decode, and give a three-line receipt. The full contract below is for a delivery render or
a first build.

## The folder decides, not the order

A person arrives wherever they arrive. They may ask to build on the first day, run the
survey before the plan, install this skill in the middle of something already half done,
or come back in March having forgotten all of it. None of that is a mistake to correct.

**Read the folder before you decide anything.** It is the only record of where they are.

| In the folder | What it means | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| nothing yet | an idea, nothing written down | start the thing they asked for |
| `PLAN-v0.md` | their own answers, sorted, not yet attacked | continue from it; never ask the ten questions again |
| `PLAN-v1.md` | attacked and answered, no outside data yet | continue from it |
| `PLAN-v2-BLUEPRINT.md` | changed by answers from real strangers | build from it, and say so |
| `PLAN-v3-BLUEPRINT.md`, v4... | the Blueprint changed later, on new evidence | the highest number is current; read that one |
| `BUSINESS-TRUTH.md` | the facts every building skill reads | read it, ask only what it does not answer |

Four rules, the same in every skill in this kit:

1. **Never re-ask what a file already answers.** Read first, then ask at most three
   things, and only about what is missing. A person who answers the same question twice
   stops trusting the machine, and they are right to.
2. **Do the thing they asked.** Never refuse because an earlier step is missing. Say in
   one line what is thin and what it risks, offer the shorter version of the missing
   step, then do what they asked if they still want it. A skill that blocks makes people
   start a new empty folder, and that is how the work gets lost.
3. **One skill answers.** Whichever skill owns the thing they actually asked for runs the
   conversation. The others contribute at most one line inside it. Two skills taking over
   the same message is how a beginner ends up answering two different interviews.
4. **Facts live in one file.** `BUSINESS-TRUTH.md`, in the folder the agent is running
   in. Plans, versions and thinking live in the `PLAN-` files. Never a second copy of
   either, anywhere. A plan under any other name (`business-plan.md`, notes, a pasted
   paragraph) still counts: read it, never ask what it already answers.

If the folder and the person disagree, the person is right and the file is old. Say which
line you are changing, change it, carry on.

## Stage 0: the machine, before the video

Run these checks and stop at the first gap with the one install command for their system
(the full list is in `SETUP.md` at the repo root). If you are not running on the person's
own machine, do not report your machine's answers as theirs: give them the four check
commands for their system and wait. Ask before installing anything: "I will
install X (about Y MB). Ok?"

1. `ffmpeg -version` and `ffprobe -version`. Missing: Mac `brew install ffmpeg`; Windows
   `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`, then reopen the terminal.
2. `node -v`. Missing: nodejs.org, the LTS installer.
3. Python: `python3 --version` on Mac, `py -3 --version` on Windows. Missing on Windows:
   `winget install Python.Python.3.12`.
4. A Remotion project. If the folder has no `package.json`, scaffold one without prompts:
   `npx create-video@latest --yes --blank <folder>` (the `--yes` is what stops the
   interactive menu; run it outside any git repository), then `npm install` inside it, then
   `npx remotion browser ensure` once (it downloads a browser for rendering; this is the
   step that looks stuck; give it a long timeout). Never let `npx` prompt mid-render:
   install first, render second.
5. The audit script sits next to this file. Call it by its absolute path:
   `python3 "<this skill's folder>/scripts/media_audit.py"` on Mac,
   `py -3 "<this skill's folder>\scripts\media_audit.py"` on Windows.

Write every command on one line, with double quotes, so it pastes into PowerShell, cmd and
a Mac terminal alike. Before writing into an existing project, list which files will change
and wait for a yes. `BUSINESS-TRUTH.md` is the exception: updating it is always allowed,
because it is the loop's memory, and every skill in the kit writes to it.

## Stage 1: the brief

`BUSINESS-TRUTH.md` lives in the folder the agent is running in, the person's project
folder, and every skill in the kit reads and writes that one file. If it is not there, ask
for the folder before anything else; never write a second copy somewhere else. Read it: the business name, the offer, the phone number, the colours and
the page address come from there, never retyped. If the file describes a
different business from the one the person is talking about, say so in one line, use
nothing from it, and ask which is right before going on. If a fact the video needs is
[PENDING] in the file (the WhatsApp number), the video cannot be `ready` until the person
supplies it; ask for that one fact. Then the delivery contract.
For a beginner who did not specify, use this contract and label every line Assumption:

```text
Canvas 1080 by 1920 (vertical, phone). 30 fps. 6 to 30 seconds. H.264 MP4, no audio unless
they gave some. Local review only. Text and simple shapes from the business facts; no stock
media, no logo unless supplied.
```

Ask at most three questions, one ask each, only ones that change the video (which product,
which line of text, which colour if none is approved). Every other unknown becomes a labelled
Assumption, not a fourth question. Show the contract and wait for the yes before the first
render; the person approves the plan the same way they approve a build in the CRM skill. Never guess a fact you could read
from a supplied file: fps, duration, orientation, colour tags of a source clip come from
`media_audit.py`, and a fact it cannot read is `[PENDING: what would settle it]`. A fact
about the brief that nobody gave is an Assumption, written down, not a stop.

## Stage 2: build

- Give the composition a stable ID and explicit width, height, fps and duration in frames.
  Changing content goes in props. One master clock: seconds in the data, frames once at the
  boundary. Read `references/remotion.md` for the composition rules.
- Every frame is a pure result of frame number, props and locked assets. Name the font and
  load it deliberately; no machine-local substitution.
- Render stills first: the first frame, one frame per text card, the last frame. Look at
  them, or if you cannot see images, print their absolute paths and ask the person to look.
- A graphics-only composition renders once, straight to H.264. A mezzanine is only for
  footage that FFmpeg will re-encode afterwards. If a render is unstable or runs out of
  memory, lower the concurrency; do not raise it.
- Renders take minutes. Run them with a long timeout, and say so before starting.

## Stage 3: verify the file, not the exit code

Run `media_audit.py <output> --decode --sha256`. `PASS` means the file decoded end to end
with zero errors; `PROBED` means nothing was decoded and proves nothing. A receipt file is
never overwritten by accident: name a new `--output` per run, or pass `--overwrite`. Then two checks
only the person can do, carried as `[PENDING: you to confirm]` until they answer: "Play
the file start to end. Does it play, and is the text readable?" and "Open these two frames:
<paths>." Read `references/ffmpeg.md` when you transform, join or convert media.

## Handoff and the check

Give: the output path, the composition ID and props, the delivery contract as met, the
audit receipt (decode result, duration, resolution, fps, SHA-256), the two frame paths, and
one word: `ready`, `not ready` or `blocked`. State that no upload, publish or spend happened.

Then run the check from the `noguess` skill on the candidate against the contract, in its
shape: Invented, Checks (met / not met / [PENDING]), Assumed without being told, Why, The
fix, Next time. If `noguess` is not installed, run those six lines inline. Write the Next
time line into `BUSINESS-TRUTH.md` under Prompting rules learned, and under What exists
now write the output path and the contract, dated.

## Rules of media that never bend

- Rec.709 tags do not convert HDR pixels; perform and verify a real transform when needed.
- Never hide a sync error with separate video and audio padding; repair the shared timeline.
- The concat demuxer only for stream-compatible files; otherwise the concat filter and one
  re-encode. Never byte-concatenate media.
- New versioned output by default. Overwrite only disposable generated files.
- Keep source media and earlier candidates. Deleting a source is never part of a render.

Remotion has its own licence: free for individuals and small teams, paid above that. Say so
once when a student builds for anyone but themselves, a client included.
