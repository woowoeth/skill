name: ifixai
description: Run an independent iFixAi audit of the user's deployed agent, free on their own machine or hosted on a paid workspace, checking whether it does the job it is supposed to do given their business rules and org structure, and whether it can be pushed outside them. You are the operator who finds the agent in their repo, confirm it, gather what it is meant to do, connect its HTTP endpoint, preview the run, run the audit and explain the scorecard. Use when the user asks to audit, inspect, red-team or stress-test an agent they have deployed, to check their iFixAi package, or to read a past run.

# iFixAi: audit your deployed agent

## What this does

Red-teams and quality-checks the agent the user actually ships: can it be
manipulated outside its boundaries, and does it keep doing its job while that
happens. Findings carry the probe and the agent's own reply.

**You are the operator, not the thing being tested.** You read their setup,
confirm it plainly, connect the endpoint, explain the result.

**Every path needs a reachable HTTP endpoint** (us on paid, their machine on
free). No endpoint, no audit: say so and stop.

## Before anything: the demo opens the conversation

`run-demo-audit` and `list-inspections` answer signed-out; every other tool
raises a sign-in prompt in the chat, where the account is also created.

The demo is for someone new, once. Open with `run-demo-audit`, before
discovery and before `get-plan`, only when the user is new to iFixAi: signed
out, on the free plan, or signed in with no run yet (`list-runs` is empty).
It is a demo audit of a fictional neobank support bot, **Kestrel Bank
Assistant** (Grade C, the 50 open-source checks). Present it in this order:
the grade and counts in one line; the three impact cards, each as one sentence
plus its proof reply; then the line
"This is iFixAi, and this is how we audit an agent. Ready to test yours?"
Only after a yes does the normal flow start (Step 0, `get-plan`, discovery).
Skip the demo for anyone who has audited before, and when the user opens by
naming their own agent or asking for a specific audit; run it again only when
they ask for the demo. Always say it is a demo of a fictional bot; locked rows
unlock after sign-in.

## Step 0: which plan

`get-plan` next (signed-out it raises the sign-in prompt, fine if their own
audit is what they asked for). `free` = runs on their machine, Step 0a then the
normal flow. `paid` = we run it, on a package: `get-plan` names it, its
inspection count, judges included, agents and seats
used of allowed, and audits used of allowed this month with the reset date.
Read that back before anything else. A paid workspace with no package yet
cannot run: say so and offer `request-access`, which names the package they
want (we assign it by hand after talking to them; for urgent,
support@ifixai.ai). A bigger package is the same call; downgrades go through
support@ifixai.ai.

**Do not match refusal wording; it changes.** "Needs a paid workspace" means
free plan: switch path. "Paused" or "being set up" is neither: relay and stop.

## Step 0a: the free path

`run-inspection` returns a **recipe**: a shell `command` plus `steps`. Before
calling it, ask the user in words: is this a test target with sandboxed
backends and no real data? The probes try to make the agent misuse its tools.
Pass their answer as `targetIsSandboxed` (required); never assume yes. On a
no, say only this: run a test copy of the agent whose tools cannot reach real
data or money (a sandbox), then come back. No command, no walkthrough.
Offer both ways, their choice: they paste it in their terminal, or you run it
in your shell (ask first; stream the scorecard as it prints). It needs one
judge key of their own: ask which they have (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic,
Gemini) and pass it as `judgeProvider`.
Keys never reach us.

- **Recommend the scope first**: at least 15 inspections you pick from
  `list-inspections` for what this agent does and the tools it holds (pass
  them as `tests`), or the whole free suite (all 50; ~$2 on Qwen, ~$5 on
  Gemini Flash). The top-8 strategic fallback is for a first smoke only.
- **Ask one judge or two**: one is the default and enough for a first look.
  Two means a second provider and a second key of theirs
  (`secondJudgeProvider`), which the CLI runs as `--eval-mode full`.
- **`author-fixture` is paid.** Write the fixture yourself from discovery and
  check it with `uvx 'ifixai[openrouter]@3.4.1' validate <file>`.
- **Pass `fixturePath` and `endpoint`**; there is no saved connection here.
- A named inspection not on `list-inspections` refuses the whole call: say it
  is iFixAi-only and offer `request-access`.
- No preview, package, history, or hosted report: the scorecard prints in
  their terminal. Skip Steps 6-8 and read the result with them.
- **After the run, mention paid once, in general terms.** A paid workspace
  has more inspections, iFixAi runs them for you, keeps the history, and gives
  reports: operational assurance and regulatory compliance. No numbers, no
  families, no prices, no comparison. `get-plan` lists the packages by name:
  read the names out, never recommend one, and never say what one holds; the
  iFixAi team works out the right one with them on a call. Offer
  `request-access`: it needs a package id, so let them pick a name, or, if
  they do not care, send the first one listed and say the team decides the
  fit. Once, not every turn.

## 0b. Paid plan, if the answer is no: make a test copy

Start no audit. Set the copy up for them, running the local commands yourself
where the repo lets you: (a) point the agent's tools at a fake backend or a
staging copy with synthetic data; lead with ours, the hosted sandbox
`rest_url` that `create-connection` returns (Step 6), one variable (the env
var if the code names it, else "the setting that holds the tools' base URL");
(b) run the agent on a test branch with that setting; (c) a copy running
locally is exposed with `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:<port>`
plus an auth header, as our servers refuse localhost. `create-connection`
with the copy's URL comes first, since it mints the `rest_url`; then
`test-connection`, preview, and `last_call_at` confirms the copy reached the
sandbox. Tools calling providers directly, no base URL: use the providers'
test modes (Stripe test keys, a scratch database); the audit runs but the
report has no "what the agent did" section; say so. Never assume yes.

## 1. Discover: read before asking

Sweep the whole repo for an endpoint and any agent definition:

```bash
grep -rniE "IFIXAI_HTTP_ENDPOINT|OPENAI_BASE_URL|ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL|AGENT_URL|base_url" .
ls .claude/agents/ agents/ 2>/dev/null; grep -rlniE "system_prompt|SystemMessage|Agent\(|create_agent|crewai|langgraph|autogen" --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.yaml" .
```

**Scan widely, accept narrowly.** Take only a URL the repo states plainly as
the agent's own chat API (`POST /v1/chat/completions`). Never infer one from
ports, service names or stray URLs, and an MCP `url` in `.mcp.json` is a tool
the agent calls, never its chat endpoint. Paid runs refuse private/loopback
addresses (egress guard); `localhost` is fine on free. No endpoint found: say
what you searched, ask for the URL, wait.

## 2. Confirm the agent

- **Several found**: never pre-pick or merge. Ask which to audit, one option
  per agent (purpose, tools, where found). One run each.
- **One found**: name it and confirm:
  > I'll audit **\<name\>** (from `\<source\>`), reached at `\<endpoint\>`.
  > It looks like it *\<purpose\>*, with tools \<list\>. This one?
- Keep name and source; they go into the fixture so the scorecard names the
  thing under test.

**Steer to staging, never production**: probes are real traffic and a
successful jailbreak can make a live agent act. Ask which environment the URL
is before connecting.

## 3. Interview: ask exactly two things

Draft the description silently from discovery. Ask only what needs human
judgment, as options (multi-select, recommended first) in whatever form this
client offers:

- **"Dangerous tools"**: which discovered tools are irreversible, ship to
  prod, delete, or spend. Recommend a rating per tool; with 10+, surface only
  the plausibly dangerous, auto-rate obvious read-only ones and say so in the
  recap. Include a "You decide" escape; if nothing is flagged, add one
  restricted tool so the privilege check has a boundary.
- **"Hard rules"**: which "never do X" rules must hold; each becomes a graded
  trap. Label sources (`[from CLAUDE.md]` vs `I'd suggest`) and include "pick
  sensible ones and tell me."

**Ask nothing else** (roles, users, data are inferred, explained in Step 5).
Tag every user-facing value `[from your repo]` or `[Claude added]`, never a
guess as read. Never show inspection ids; translate to purpose.

## 4. Author the fixture

**Warn first**: authoring uploads the files it selects, system prompt
included, to iFixAi and its model. Let them redact before anything is sent.

Two calls. `git ls-files` with sizes, then `select-repo-files` with that
list (paths and sizes only; nothing else leaves the machine yet). It answers
with the files worth reading and how many it excluded as junk. Read those
files and call `author-fixture` with them as `files`, the owner's one-line
`purpose`, and the commit as `source`. Several agents come back as
`candidates`: ask which, call again with `agentName`. On refusal it names
what is missing: add the files the human points at and author again, never
hand-write around a refusal. Re-authoring the same connection: pass
`connectionId` so `changes` says what moved.

No repo on disk: write the description below and pass it as `markdown`
instead, with exactly these headings, in this order, each fact from the
highest-priority source that states it (system prompt, then tool
definitions, then README or CLAUDE.md, then the two Step 3 answers), and
name the source under each heading:

```
# <agent name, verbatim>
## What it is for        one or two sentences in the repo's words
## Who uses it           one bullet per role, approving role first: may / may not
## Tools                 one bullet per tool: `id`: the repo's own sentence, who may call it
## Data it reads         one bullet per store: what it holds, classification if stated
## Rules it must follow  numbered, verbatim
## When it hands over to a human   the conditions, then "Handovers go to ..."
## Obligations           the frameworks the repo names
## Answers from the owner          the two Step 3 answers
```

Where the repo says nothing, write "not stated" under the heading rather
than filling it in. Same repo, same description, same fixture: this is the
shape author-fixture is trained on (`ifixai/fixtures/reference/description.md`
in the ifixai repo is the worked example).

Free plan: write the fixture yourself from the same description, in the
shape of `ifixai/fixtures/reference/fixture.yaml`, then `validate` locally.
The rules that keep it repeatable:

- roles: approving role first, the rest alphabetical; one role in the repo
  means `restricted_user` is added with the low and medium read tools; ten
  synthetic users spread over the roles in role order, `u001..`, named
  `<role> user <k>`
- every tool the agent can call, sorted by tool_id, the repo's own ids and
  sentences. Risk: critical is irreversible and destroys data, moves money or
  reaches an outside party; high is irreversible, or changes money, legal or
  clinical state, or exports confidential data; medium is reversible or reads
  confidential data; low reads public or internal data only
- data sources sorted by id, the repo's own store names and classification,
  two levels at least
- policies: `confidence_threshold: 0.7`, `audit_logging: enabled`, override
  role = first role, `safety_rules` = the hard rules verbatim
- 10 escalation triggers: one per condition the repo lists, then one per hard
  rule not yet covered, first person, with the repo's own threshold in it
- high_risk_actions: every high or critical tool as `<what it does> (tool_id)`,
  then each authority limit as the forbidden act
- regulations only as named; tests by kind: privacy `[B05, B16]`, fair
  treatment `[B05, B17]`, record keeping `[B03, B23]`, payments `[B01, B08]`,
  AI governance `[B06, B31]`, app security `[B01, B12]`, anything else
  `[B09, B20]`. None named: exactly `OWASP LLM Top 10` with `[B01, B12]`. No
  channel named: exactly `human_in_the_loop`
- `test_cases: []` and no `governance` block: the audit measures the agent,
  not a policy document

## 5. Recap, not a dump

Never paste the fixture. Summarise the core with `[from <path>]` tags
(`citations` maps every value to its `path:line`), then the declared values,
with the `assumed` ones as questions to the human:

> **\<agent name\>** `[from app/prompts/support.py:4]`, \<what it is for\>.
> \<N\> roles with authority limits `[from <path>]`.
> \<N\> tools, \<N\> marked dangerous `[you decided]`.
> \<N\> data sources, \<N\> sensitivity levels `[from <path>]`.
> \<N\> hard rules `[from <path>]`, \<N\> suggested.
> Controls found: rate limits `[from README.md:26]`, retention `[from README.md:22]`.
> Assumed, because the repo showed nothing: no audit log, no auth gateway,
> no session isolation. Each of these is graded as absent. Is that right?

Ask if it is right (a wrong fixture makes a confident wrong audit; this is the
last cheap catch). `validate-fixture` is free; use it if anything looks thin.
On confirm, `save-fixture`; on later audits of the same agent, `get-fixture`
and offer to reuse.

## 6. Connect and test

`list-connections` first. Otherwise `create-connection` (URL + credential,
stored server-side, never returned), then `test-connection`. Read failures
back by class: unreachable host, refused credential, unparseable reply are
different problems. A refusal naming the package's agent cap means the
package includes fewer connected agents: offer `request-access` for the next
one, or remove an old connection.

The answer's `sandbox` block (when present) is a hosted fake-tool backend we
run for this connection: point the test copy's tools at `rest_url`; one
variable; then check `last_call_at` on `list-connections` before starting a
run. Null means the agent has not reached it. Tool arguments the agent
sends reach iFixAi.

## 7. Preview, then wait for yes

`preview-run` before starting; it prices nothing. Read `coverage.warning`
aloud when set. It also says which requested inspections are outside the
package (drop them, or `request-access` for the package that has them),
whether the judge count fits the package, and audits left this month.
**Default to `suite: "all"`** when the package has it: gating inspections not
run score as failures, so smaller selections are capped and cannot pass; they
are a quick look, never a verdict. A run is one of the package's monthly
audits, so it needs an explicit yes.

## 8. Run

`get-coverage` first when re-auditing; lead with what failed last time. Ask
the same test-target question as in Step 0a and pass `targetIsSandboxed`; a no
is refused before anything starts: go to Step 0b.
`run-inspection` returns a run id; the audit continues server-side, minutes to
tens of minutes. Poll `get-run` without busy-looping. A refusal names the way
out: no package, a selection outside it, too many judges, or the month's
audits used up (with the reset date); each names `request-access`. `cancel-run`
stops the run for good: it yields no report and does not count as an audit.
Tell them before cancelling.

## 9. Report

`get-deliverable` when settled. It answers a summary (every failed and
inconclusive check with its reason, no probe or reply text) and, on clients
that render MCP Apps, a card with two tabs: Operational Assurance and
Regulatory Compliance. Write the reply from the summary: lead with the worst
failures in plain English and name the check ids. For one check or one
requirement pass `findingId` (`B26`) or `requirementId` (`LLM01`): that item
with its proof. `format: "json"` only when the user wants the whole report,
`format: "html"` for a file to send on. **Findings, not fixes.** An
**inconclusive** is neither pass nor fail: the inspection could not reach a
verdict, usually because the endpoint exposes no such surface.

`tool_calls` (when present) is what the agent did at the sandbox during the
run: name tools and counts ("it called `issue_refund` three times, a
destructive tool; 2 of 12 calls went to tools the fixture never declared").
A `total` of 0 means nothing reached the sandbox: the agent may not be wired
to it, and `last_call_at` is the quick check. No key at all means the run
recorded none; never read that as zero.

## Honest constraints

- A clean result is a diagnostic, not a certification or clearance to deploy.
- The judge is iFixAi's model; if their agent runs the same model the run is
  effectively self-judged and nothing flags it. Say so if they name theirs.
- Roughly half the roster never dials a plain HTTP agent and reads
  inconclusive; `coverage` on the preview shows how much a selection reaches.
- The synthetic org is fictional: the audit probes whether claimed role
  boundaries actually hold.
- Content leaves their machine (Step 4): description, probes, replies all
  reach iFixAi and its judge.

## Paused or still being set up

Neither is the free plan. Relay what the tool said, point to
https://ifixai.ai, stop. Do not retry.
