name: video-editing-skill
description: Deterministic video editing from a typed edit request (trim, cut, concat with transitions, speed change, fit / fill / resize, still-image overlay) with an exact source-to-timeline mapping and per-operation provenance. Executes through ffmpeg-skill; never takes commands, argv, filter strings or executables. Use when an agent has already decided what to edit and needs the edit performed, verified and traced. Not for deciding what to cut, transcribing, captioning, colour grading or audio mastering.

# video-editing-skill

`video-editing run - --json --workspace DIR [--allowed-input ROOT]` reads one request document on stdin and
prints one response document on stdout. Everything else (`skill`, `doctor`, `validate`, `plan`) is documented in
`README.md`; the machine-readable contract is `video-editing contract --json`.

Workflow for a caller:

1. `doctor --json --workspace DIR` once: `ok` must be true; `operations[]` says per type whether it is AVAILABLE
   (tool present, encoders / filters found by ffmpeg-skill's doctor) and `supported_operations` lists exactly those.
2. Build the request from the contract's `request_shape`: sources (files under an allowed root), allowlisted
   operations with typed params, outputs (relative paths under the workspace).
3. `plan - --json` to see the operation graph, the timeline mapping, the tool per step and the commands
   ffmpeg-skill would run. Nothing is written.
4. `run - --json`. On success every output carries its sha256, size, timeline and an OBSERVED probe; every source
   its probe; every operation a provenance record (`completed` / `reused`); the document is self-checked against the
   contract shape before it is printed. On failure `{"ok": false, "error": {code, message, retryable, details}}`,
   the failed record with its error, later operations `skipped`, and no output file is left behind.

Media rules (`contract.media_compatibility`): every source is probed first; `OVERLAY` needs a video input with an
audio stream; `CONCAT` conforms sizes / rates and adds audio when any input has it. Engine gaps (a missing
ffmpeg-skill tool, encoder or filter) are refused before execution as `TOOL_ERROR`.

Operation types (the allowlist): `TRIM`, `CUT`, `CONCAT` (with `params.transition`), `SPEED`, `FIT`, `FILL`,
`RESIZE`, `OVERLAY`. Anything else (`CROP`, `FREEZE`, `REVERSE`, `IMAGE_INSERT`, `POSITION` included) is refused
with `UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION`; the contract's `unsupported` list says why.

Times are exact: `"1:30"`, `"00:01:30.250"`, `{"frames": 300, "fps": "30000/1001"}` or a number of seconds.

Frames are exact too: `RESIZE` keeps the aspect (`width` → `height = even(width × sh / sw)`), `FIT` pads to an aspect,
`FILL` crops to it; the target frame is reported before execution (`normalized.target_frame`) and verified after.
`outputs[].encoding` may set `crf` (14..28) and `preset` (x264 vocabulary); nothing else about encoding is
configurable (`contract.encoding`).

`contract --check tests/contract/contract.json` verifies the live contract against the implementation, the docs
and that saved copy; exit 1 on any problem.
