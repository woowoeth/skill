# Windows Harness

Use one CLI call per decision point, not per primitive:

```bash
windows-harness <<'PY'
app = "Notepad"
win.see(app)
win.type("hello", app=app)
print(win.see(app))
PY
```

The CLI preloads `win`, lazy `browser`, `Path`, and `subprocess`. Prefer bounded
stdin programs; reserve `windows-harness repl` for manual exploration and always
exit it.

## How to invoke: exactly two forms

One-off questions — use a subcommand (identical in PowerShell, cmd, and bash):

```bash
windows-harness apps                 # app inventory, compact JSON (--all adds system windows)
windows-harness see "CC Switch"      # one screenshot -> JSON with its "path"
windows-harness state "Notepad"      # UIA tree as JSON (--screenshot adds image)
```

Anything multi-step — write a `.py` file, then run it. No quoting or encoding
traps in any shell; this is always the most reliable channel:

```bash
windows-harness run task.py          # win, browser, Path, subprocess preloaded
```

Write generated task scripts to the harness scripts dir (printed by
`windows-harness doctor` as `scripts_dir`, default
`%USERPROFILE%\.windows-harness\scripts`); `run` resolves bare filenames
there. Never write task scripts into the caller's working directory or
invent ad-hoc folders like `.windows-harness-temp/` — they pollute the
user's repo and show up as untracked files. Never run them via
`python script.py` / `python -c` either: bypassing `windows-harness run`
also bypasses the preloaded `win` session, so every call pays a fresh
interpreter start and loses the element table behind `element_index`.

Never use `<<'PY'` heredocs outside bash; never enumerate windows through
hand-rolled C#/PowerShell — `win.list_apps()` already did it. Screenshots
land in `%TEMP%\windows-harness-*.png` and persist: the returned `"path"`
stays readable after the CLI exits, so just open it. Set
`WINDOWS_HARNESS_OVERLAY=off` to skip the pointer renderer for minimum
latency.

## Delivery: foreground first

Every input primitive takes `delivery="foreground"` (default) or
`delivery="background"`.

| mode | transports | disturbance |
|---|---|---|
| `foreground` (default) | front the target + SendInput; pen/message fallback when hook software swallows SendInput | the target comes to the front and STAYS (`hold=True`) until `win.release()` |
| `background` | synthetic-pen injection, PostMessage, UIA patterns | none — never fronts, never moves the cursor |

Why foreground is the default: focus-driven UI (search boxes with suggestion
popups, context menus, IME candidate windows) closes the instant its window
loses the foreground, and CEF off-screen / XAML input stacks only accept
message input while truly foreground and focused. Holding the foreground
across a burst turns "sometimes works" into a procedure.

- `win.release()` hands the foreground back to the user's previous window.
  Call it when a task burst is done.
- For one quick invisible action use `delivery="foreground", hold=False`
  (cloaked ~150 ms takeover, restored after) or `delivery="background"`.
- Foreground clicks use SendInput mouse events and do NOT summon the Windows
  touch keyboard; synthetic pen/touch injection (background clicks) can pop
  it up and wreck the focus chain — avoid pen taps into text fields.
- `background` results carry `"mode": "pen" | "message"` plus
  `"verified": false` when the effect cannot be confirmed. When a framework's
  input stack silently drops background events the call raises
  `BackgroundUnavailable` with a structured `code`; redo the SAME action with
  default foreground delivery — do not probe more background transports.
- `windows-harness doctor` reports `input_health.sendinput`: `ok`,
  `swallowed` (hook software such as audio enhancers or overlay recorders is
  eating injected events — suspects under `possible_injectors`), or
  `unknown`. When SendInput is swallowed, foreground actions automatically
  fall back to pen/message transports against the now-foreground target.

## Use the small surface

Think in seven verbs: `see`, `key`, `type`, `click`, `paste`, `ax`, `script`
— plus two inventory calls: `win.list_apps()` (processes with their window
titles) and `win.windows(app)` (one app's windows).

```python
frame = win.see("Notepad")
win.key("ctrl+s", app="Notepad")
win.type("Alessia Cara", app="Notepad")                    # type at the focused field
win.type("Alessia Cara", app="Notepad", x=640, y=420)      # click the field, then type
win.click(640, 420, app="Notepad")
win.click(640, 420, app="Notepad", clicks=2)               # double click
win.click(640, 420, app="Notepad", button="right")         # context menu
win.drag(200, 300, 500, 600, app="Notepad")                # press, glide, release
win.scroll(-720, app="Notepad")                            # wheel at window center (or x/y)
win.hover(640, 420, app="Notepad")                         # really hover -> tooltip appears
win.paste("Alessia Cara", app="Notepad")                   # clipboard paste (see ladder)
win.release()                                              # hand the foreground back

item = win.ax.at(640, 420, app="Notepad")
win.ax.perform(item["element_index"], "invoke")
win.ax.click(item["element_index"])      # click the element's center — no coordinates
win.ax.hover(item["element_index"])      # hover it so its tooltip fires

win.script("Get-Process | Select-Object -First 3 Name")
```

`win.click()` is raw coordinate input; it never guesses a UIA action. For
semantic actions use `win.ax.at()` + `win.ax.perform()`, and fill text fields
with `win.ax.set_value()` (verified by read-back) when an element exposes a
ValuePattern — no keystrokes at all. `win.ax.click()` / `win.ax.hover()` act
on the element's own BoundingRectangle center: coordinates never leave the
harness, so no coordinate-space mismatch is possible — prefer them over
copying frame values into `win.click()` yourself.

`win.hover(x, y)` delivers a real hover (physical cursor, or pen hover when
SendInput is filtered) so tooltips and hover-only UI appear; `win.move(x, y)`
only animates the virtual pointer and delivers no input. Hover is
coordinate-routed — the target needs to be unoccluded, not foreground — and
the cursor stays put so the tooltip survives long enough for a `win.see()`.

## Modal dialogs and overlays

`win.see(app)` is **window-scoped**: it captures only that one window's client
area, so an overlay sitting on top (a Save As / Open / Print dialog, a
confirm prompt) is **not** in the shot even though it is on screen. To see a
popup that just appeared, do not guess its title:

```python
win.key("ctrl+s", app="Notepad")        # an untitled doc opens Save As
fg = win.foreground_window()            # the dialog's title/hwnd
frame = win.see(fg["hwnd"])             # capture the dialog itself
# or grab the whole desktop, which sees every window at once:
desktop = win.capture_screen()
```

`win.capture_screen()` captures the entire virtual desktop (all monitors) and
its screenshot-space coordinates pair with `coordinate_space="screen"`. A bare
`win.see()` with no app now targets the foreground window, so it also catches a
modal that is currently in front.

`win.see(app, bring_to_front=True)` fronts the target and keeps it fronted
(restoring it if minimized) until `win.release()`; the default is a quiet
background grab that never raises or activates the window, so `see` stays
non-intrusive unless you opt in.

## Text input ladder

1. `win.ax.set_value()` when the element exposes a ValuePattern — verified by
   read-back and works fully in the background.
2. `win.type(text, x=..., y=...)` — focuses the field and types in one call.
3. `win.paste(text)` — the clipboard route. Setting the clipboard is a plain
   data handoff no hook software can filter; only the paste trigger needs
   input (SendInput Ctrl+V, or a posted WM_PASTE when SendInput is filtered —
   never a posted Ctrl+V, whose modifier never reaches GetKeyState). Focus
   the target field first (a click, or `win.type` with x/y).
4. If the paste trigger also fails: right-click the field and click the
   context menu's Paste item (pen injection can drive the menu).
5. When `doctor` reports `input_health.sendinput == "swallowed"`, tell the
   user which processes (`possible_injectors`) are eating injected input —
   removing the hook software is the real fix.

`win.type()` reports what actually landed, not just that keystrokes were sent.
XAML/WinUI text boxes (Win11 Notepad, Settings) and CEF editors drop much of a
`KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` burst while claiming `verified: True`; the harness reads
the field back and, on a mismatch, retries via `win.ax.set_value()` (verified)
or `win.paste()`. If the result carries `"retried_via"`, the keyboard route
dropped characters and the retry landed them. The result's `verified_via`
says how `verified` was established: `"value_pattern"`/`"clipboard"` mean a
read-back confirmed the text, `"transport"` means the target exposes no
readable text state and only delivery was confirmed. A `verified: false` with
a `read_back` field means the window accepted the keystrokes but the text did
not appear (e.g. an app-launch/session-restore race) — click the field and
retry, or switch to `win.paste()`.

Replacing a field's existing text: there is no reliable select-all keystroke
on hook-filtered machines (Ctrl+A is a combo and refuses; CEF ignores a
posted Backspace). The dependable sequence is a triple click —
`win.click(x, y, clicks=3)` selects the field's text — then `win.type` or
`win.paste`, which replaces the selection. On machines with healthy
SendInput, `win.key("ctrl+a")` first is fine too.

Bare keys vs combos: when SendInput is swallowed, `win.key("enter")` and
other modifier-less keys still work (posted to the foreground target); only
combos like `ctrl+a` refuse, honestly.

## Coordinates

`coordinate_space` accepts:

- `'screenshot'` (default) — pixels of the latest `win.see()` image; the
  returned `scale_x`/`scale_y` map them to the window.
- `'normalized'` — a 0..1000 grid over the client area of the window from the
  latest `win.see()`, independent of screenshot resolution and DPI; use
  directly when the model outputs normalized coordinates:

  ```python
  frame = win.see("Notepad")                          # anchors the window
  win.click(500, 48, app="Notepad", coordinate_space="normalized")
  ```

  The window's origin is resolved live at click time, so the window may move
  between `see()` and `click()`; only a resize invalidates the grid — take a
  fresh `see()` after any resize.
- `'client'` / `'screen'` — raw window-client or physical screen pixels.

Every positional primitive (`click`, `double/right click`, `drag`, `scroll`
with x/y, `type` with x/y, `hover`) accepts `coordinate_space`; the
normalized grid works for all of them.

Default to vision + normalized coordinates; only fall back to element centers
from the ax tree when you need semantic identity or a layout shift makes a
coordinate fragile. ax output reports frames in the pixel space of your latest
`win.see()` screenshot of that window (the `frame` key, alongside
`"frame_space": "screenshot"` in `state`), so they drop straight into the
default coordinate space. Without a matching screenshot the raw physical
screen pixels are reported under `frame_screen` instead — those only pair
with `coordinate_space="screen"`, never the default. Cleanest of all is
keeping numbers out of the loop: `win.ax.click(element_index)` /
`win.ax.hover(element_index)`.

Target apps by exe name when titles can collide — resolution prefers an
exact process-name match (`"Discord.exe"`, or bare `"Discord"`), then an
exact title, and only then substrings, so a window whose title merely
mentions the name (a VS Code tab titled "… Discord …") never hijacks the
query.

## Action proof: look only when it misfires

Every coordinate primitive (`click`, `drag`, `scroll`, `hover`, `type` with
x/y) stamps the intended point back onto the screenshot it was anchored to and
returns the path under `result["proof"]["path"]`. The `proof` key is optional:
it is present only when annotation is on (the default) and the proof was
actually generated, so read it through `result.get("proof")` before using it.

```python
out = win.click(640, 420, app="Notepad")
proof = out.get("proof")
print(proof["path"] if proof else "no proof")   # annotated PNG you can open
```

It stays absent for non-coordinate primitives (`key`, `paste`, `move`,
`ax.click`, `see`) and for any call given `annotate=False`, or when
`WINDOWS_HARNESS_PROOF=off`.

* `click` / double / right / `hover` / click-to-`type` draw a red reticle
  (circle-cross) at the point, labelled with the button and count.
* `scroll` draws an arrow from the anchor point (the window centre whenever
  `x`/`y` are omitted) in the direction of the wheel delta.
* `drag` draws the glide as a blue line with a reticle at the start and a
  square at the end.

Do NOT open the proof on every action — the input already ran. Open it only
to decide WHY a coordinate action mis-landed: you aimed at the wrong spot, the
effect did not happen, or you need to nudge a coordinate before retrying. A
normal `win.see()` on the finished step is the usual confirmation.

The concrete trigger: an action reports success (or `verified: true`) but
`win.verify_change(app)` says nothing changed, or a `win.see()` shows the page
changed in a way you did not expect. In that case open
`result["proof"]["path"]` FIRST — before retrying, nudging, or switching
transports. The reticle on the anchored screenshot tells you at a glance
whether the input even landed where you intended; guessing from coordinates
alone just burns rounds.

Forgot to print the proof path, or need an earlier one? Every proof is
journaled to `proofs.jsonl` under the harness config dir (default
`%USERPROFILE%\.windows-harness`) as it is written, so history survives
across CLI invocations:

```python
win.last_proof()                      # newest proof whose PNG still exists
win.proofs(limit=5)                   # recent proofs, newest first
win.proofs(app="Notepad", kind="click")   # filter by process/title and kind
```

Each entry carries the same fields as `result["proof"]` plus `ts` and the
target `app` (process/title); entries whose PNG was cleaned up are skipped. Pass
`annotate=False` to any primitive (or set `WINDOWS_HARNESS_PROOF=off`) to turn
the proof off for a coordinate you already know is good.

## Minimize round trips

- Bundle deterministic, reversible steps into one program, then verify once.
- Stop at a genuine decision boundary: ambiguous identity, new coordinates, an
  irreversible action, or unexpected state.
- Do not screenshot merely to confirm a known shortcut opened a field before
  typing; let the final screenshot verify the whole sequence.
- Poll exact UIA state inside the same Python program when possible.
- Use the cheapest strong end-state check: one screenshot for visible state,
  one exact UIA query for semantic state.

## Choose the lowest useful mode

Vision-first: if you can read a screenshot, lead with `win.see(app)` +
normalized coordinates (a 0..1000 grid) instead of the UIA tree. Many apps
(Electron/custom-drawn UI, game launchers, some frameless and webview
windows) expose no usable UIA tree, and even when they do, screenshot +
coordinates need no per-app support. Reach for `win.ax` only when you need
semantic identity or state.

1. Use `win.script()` for a known exact command (Get-Process, registry reads).
2. Otherwise use `win.see(app)` and vision: locate the target in the
   screenshot, then act with `coordinate_space="normalized"` (0..1000) so the
   numbers are resolution/DPI independent.
3. Prefer a known keyboard route; use a verified coordinate for a visible,
   low-risk target.
4. Use targeted `win.ax` only when semantic identity or state matters. For
   CEF/Electron custom-drawn UI (chat apps, music players, game launchers)
   the tree fills lazily: `state`/`ax.query`/`ax.at` automatically warm a
   near-empty CEF tree with a brief (usually invisible, cloaked) foreground
   round, so warm it once if you truly need a semantic handle. Icon-only
   controls (server/avatar images) often expose only generic names — hover
   them (`win.ax.hover`) and read the tooltip from a `win.see()`. If a dump
   still comes back near-empty with a `note`, go straight to screenshot +
   normalized coordinate clicks instead of spending more rounds on UIA.
5. Use `delivery="background"` only for apps already proven to accept it on
   this machine (classic Win32 controls, UIA patterns) — it is the quiet
   opt-in, not the default to probe with.

After a failed verified burst, switch mode or stop. Never repair uncertainty
with repeated keys, clicks, deletion loops, or bulk input.

## Verify, then teach the matrix

- After a `"verified": false` action, confirm the effect with
  `win.verify_change(app)` — a background pixel diff that costs no focus and
  no vision round trip. Use a full `win.see()` only when you need to know
  WHAT changed, not THAT it changed. Animated windows (video, games) report
  change on their own; verify those semantically through `win.ax` instead.
- When a background action provably had no effect (verify_change negative AND
  the task did not advance), record it once with `win.note_drop(kind)` — e.g.
  `win.note_drop("text_input", app="...")`. Future background calls against
  that window class refuse honestly instead of repeating a dead transport.

## Keep the invariants

- Foreground `hold=True` keeps the target fronted across the whole burst;
  always end a task with `win.release()` (or leave the window fronted
  deliberately and say so).
- Background delivery NEVER activates, raises, or moves the cursor. Occluded
  targets refuse with `background_occluded` rather than being raised.
- ax queries against CEF/Electron windows (`Chrome_WidgetWin*`) whose tree is
  near-empty auto-warm it with a brief cloaked foreground takeover; the
  previous foreground is restored when the warm-up round ends.
- Elevated (Administrator) targets are detected up front (UIPI preflight) and
  refused with `background_uipi_blocked`; run the harness elevated to drive them.
- The animated pointer is click-through and never moves the physical cursor;
  non-held foreground rungs move it briefly and put it back.
- Minimized windows are restored before foreground input and stay restored
  under `hold=True`; non-held foreground rungs re-minimize afterwards.
- Prefer semantic UIA patterns over simulated window chrome: frameworks that
  draw their own titlebar (WinUI3, Electron) may ignore posted WM_CLOSE and
  caption-button Invoke. The framework-neutral close is the WindowPattern —
  `win.ax.raw(i).GetWindowPattern().Close()` — then answer the app's own
  confirmation through `ax.perform(..., "invoke")`.
- XAML apps (Win11 Notepad, Settings, UWP frames) refuse background typing —
  use `win.ax.set_value()` there; WPF refuses background drag and scroll —
  use default foreground delivery.

## Browser tasks

Use the preloaded lazy `browser` object whenever the task lives inside a web
page. It exposes Browser Harness helpers and connects to the real browser on
first use:

```python
print(browser.page_info())
browser.new_tab("https://example.com")
```

Do not substitute OS input for CDP inside web content; keep Windows primitives
for browser chrome, native dialogs, downloads, and everything outside the page.

Run `windows-harness doctor` to inspect the runtime without changing anything.
